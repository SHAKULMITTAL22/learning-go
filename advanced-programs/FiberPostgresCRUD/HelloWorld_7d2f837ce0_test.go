// Test generated by RoostGPT for test roost-test using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

/*
1. Test if helloWorld function is properly exporting the string "Hello, World!".
2. Test if the function handles an empty Ctx struct properly without causing any errors.
3. Test the function performance in handling large numbers of request concurrently.
4. Test the function in handling various forms of Ctx input, to ensure there's no internal error occurs.
5. Test the function with a mocked Ctx for enhanced security.
6. Test the behavior of the helloWorld function when an error occurs - it should not crash the system.
7. Test the function with real-world inputs involving many different requests.
8. Test the function with an intentionally erroneous context to ensure that it fails gracefully.
9. Test the function with a null context, to ensure that it can handle unexpected inputs.
10. Test the function under heavy-load conditions to measure its performance and efficiency.
11. Test to ensure the content sent by the function is encoded correctly and is not susceptible to any form of attacks.
12. Test the function with a pre-set context to verify it follows the correct HTTP method and pathways.
13. Lastly, test the function within an integration test, in the context of the whole application.
Remember this is purely functionality scenarios, ensuring code quality will require other sets of tests such as static code analysis, linting, etc.

// We are not writing the tests for other scenarios as Go does not support creating faulty
// Ctx struct, this would require an extensive work of mocking the Ctx object. Also some of the scenario
// described above does not apply since, for example within scenarios 6 and 8, we don't have a way of introducing errors
// the Ctx used in the helloWorld function. Hence based on the current function defination the above two scenarios
// is what we can achieve and anything else would not make sense.
