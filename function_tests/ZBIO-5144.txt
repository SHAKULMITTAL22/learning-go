FUNCTIONAL TEST CASE:
Functional Test Cases:
--------------------------

1. Test Case: Verify the functionality of the "SampleComponent" component.
   - Input: Render the "SampleComponent" component
   - Expected Output: "SampleComponent" component should be rendered correctly with the expected layout and content.
   - Edge Case: "SampleComponent" component should handle any changes in the props and update the render accordingly.

2. Test Case: Verify the functionality of the "ExampleComponent" component.
   - Input: Render the "ExampleComponent" component
   - Expected Output: "ExampleComponent" component should be rendered correctly with the expected layout and content.
   - Edge Case: "ExampleComponent" component should handle any changes in the props and update the render accordingly.

3. Test Case: Verify the functionality of the "TestComponent" component.
   - Input: Render the "TestComponent" component
   - Expected Output: "TestComponent" component should be rendered correctly with the expected layout and content.
   - Edge Case: "TestComponent" component should handle any changes in the props and update the render accordingly.

Non-Functional Test Cases:
-----------------------------

1. Test Case: Verify the performance of the React JS components.
   - Input: Render the React JS components
   - Expected Output: All React JS components should render quickly without any noticeable delay.
   - Edge Case: React JS components should handle high traffic and not crash.

2. Test Case: Verify the usability of the React JS components.
   - Input: User interactions with the React JS components
   - Expected Output: All React JS components should be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
   - Edge Case: React JS components should handle user errors gracefully with clear and informative error messages.

3. Test Case: Verify the security of the React JS components.
   - Input: User interactions with the React JS components
   - Expected Output: All React JS components should not expose sensitive data and should have measures to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Edge Case: React JS components should handle malicious attacks such as Cross-site scripting (XSS), etc.

4. Test Case: Verify the compatibility of the React JS components.
   - Input: Render the React JS components on different browsers and devices
   - Expected Output: All React JS components should render correctly on all supported browsers and devices.
   - Edge Case: React JS components should handle any incompatibilities gracefully with clear and informative error messages.

GHERKIN FILE :
Feature: React JS components identification and testing
  As a QA engineer
  I want to identify and test each React JS component
  So that I can ensure the functionality of each component is working as expected

  Scenario: Identify and test a React JS component
    Given I have a React JS application
    When I identify a component named "<ComponentName>"
    Then I should be able to write a test for "<ComponentName>"

    Examples:
      | ComponentName |
      | SampleComponent |
      | ExampleComponent |
      | TestComponent |
