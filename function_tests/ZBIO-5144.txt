FUNCTIONAL TEST CASES:

1. Test Case: Validate the API endpoints
   - Input: Correct API endpoint as per the specification
   - Expected Output: Response status should be 200
   - Edge Case: Try with incorrect API endpoint and expect status 404

2. Test Case: Test the server response to correct Functional Test Cases from Requirements
   - Input: Correct Functional Test Cases from Requirements
   - Expected Output: Response status should be 200 and should display the correct test specs
   - Edge Case: Try with incorrect Functional Test Cases from Requirements and expect status 400 and an error message

3. Test Case: Test the functionality of Cards â€“ Collections & Recovery
   - Input: Valid card details for collection and recovery
   - Expected Output: Correct response as per the business logic and status 200
   - Edge Case: Try with invalid card details and expect an error message with appropriate status code

NON-FUNCTIONAL TEST CASES:

1. Test Case: Test the system performance under load
   - Input: Simulate high load on the system by sending multiple simultaneous requests
   - Expected Output: System should be able to handle the load without crashing or slowing down significantly
   - Edge Case: Try with extremely high load to identify the breaking point of the system

2. Test Case: Test the system resilience
   - Input: Simulate failures in dependent APIs or services
   - Expected Output: System should be able to handle failures gracefully without crashing
   - Edge Case: Try with multiple simultaneous failures to test the system's robustness

3. Test Case: Test the system security
   - Input: Attempt to access sensitive data or functionalities without proper authentication
   - Expected Output: System should not allow unauthorized access and should return appropriate error messages
   - Edge Case: Try with different types of attacks like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc. to test the system's vulnerability

4. Test Case: Test system compatibility
   - Input: Send requests from different platforms and devices
   - Expected Output: System should be able to handle requests from all supported platforms and devices without any issues
   - Edge Case: Try with unsupported platforms or devices and expect appropriate error messages.

REACT COMPONENT TEST CASES:

1. Test Case: Validate the React component rendering
   - Input: Load the application
   - Expected Output: All components should render as expected without any errors
   - Edge Case: Try loading the application with slow network speed and verify the components are still rendering correctly

2. Test Case: Validate the state updates in React component
   - Input: Perform an action that should change the state of a component (e.g., click a button)
   - Expected Output: Component's state should be updated as per the action performed
   - Edge Case: Try performing an action that should not change the state and verify that the state remains unchanged

3. Test Case: Validate the props passing between React components
   - Input: Pass props from a parent component to a child component
   - Expected Output: Child component should receive and use the props as expected
   - Edge Case: Try passing invalid or unexpected props and verify that the child component handles it correctly.
