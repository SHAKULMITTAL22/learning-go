FUNCTIONAL TEST CASE:
Functional Test Cases:
--------------------------

1. Test Case for Repository Details:
   - Input: Repository details provided by the HSBC team including source code and requirements.
   - Expected Result: The repository details should be correctly read and understood by the system, and the source code should compile without errors.
   - Edge Case: Test with invalid or incomplete repository details.

2. Test Case for API Integration:
   - Input: APIs exposed at the HSBC Developer Portal.
   - Expected Result: The APIs should be accessible and return the correct responses as per the API specifications.
   - Edge Case: Test with invalid API endpoints or APIs that are not available.

3. Test Case for Cards – Collections & Recovery Functionality:
   - Input: Actions related to Cards – Collections & Recovery functionality.
   - Expected Result: The actions should be executed correctly, and the system should respond as per the requirements.
   - Edge Case: Test with invalid actions or data.

4. Test Case for TDD:
   - Input: Functional Test Cases from Requirements and Source Code.
   - Expected Result: The system should be able to generate test specs based on the functional test cases and source code.
   - Edge Case: Test with incomplete or invalid functional test cases or source code.

Non-Functional Test Cases:
------------------------------

1. Test Case for System Performance:
   - Input: High load or stress conditions.
   - Expected Result: The system should be able to handle high loads or stress conditions without significant performance degradation.
   - Edge Case: Test with extremely high loads or stress conditions that exceed the system's capacity.

2. Test Case for API Response Time:
   - Input: API requests.
   - Expected Result: The APIs should return responses within an acceptable time frame as per the API specifications.
   - Edge Case: Test with large amounts of data that may slow down the response time.

3. Test Case for System Security:
   - Input: Various security threats or attacks.
   - Expected Result: The system should be able to withstand various security threats or attacks without compromising the system's integrity.
   - Edge Case: Test with sophisticated security threats or attacks that may bypass common security measures.

4. Test Case for System Availability:
   - Input: Various operating conditions.
   - Expected Result: The system should be available for use under various operating conditions.
   - Edge Case: Test with extreme operating conditions that may cause the system to be unavailable. 

5. Test Case for Mockito Virtualisation:
   - Input: Dependencies that need to be virtualised/mocked.
   - Expected Result: Mockito should be able to correctly virtualise/mock the dependencies.
   - Edge Case: Test with complex dependencies that may be difficult to virtualise/mock.

Feature: Functional Testing
  Scenario Outline: Repository Details
    Given the system has repository details "<repository_details>"
    When the system reads and understands the repository details
    Then the source code should compile without errors
    Examples:
      | repository_details |
      | Valid details |
      | Invalid details |
      | Incomplete details |

  Scenario Outline: API Integration
    Given the system has APIs exposed at the HSBC Developer Portal "<api>"
    When the system accesses the APIs
    Then the APIs should return the correct responses as per the API specifications
    Examples:
      | api |
      | Valid API endpoints |
      | Invalid API endpoints |
      | Unavailable API endpoints |

  Scenario Outline: Cards – Collections & Recovery Functionality
    Given the system has actions related to Cards – Collections & Recovery functionality "<actions>"
    When the system executes the actions
    Then the actions should be executed correctly and the system should respond as per the requirements
    Examples:
      | actions |
      | Valid actions |
      | Invalid actions |
      | Invalid data |

  Scenario Outline: TDD
    Given the system has functional Test Cases from Requirements and Source Code "<test_cases>"
    When the system generates test specs based on the functional test cases and source code
    Then the system should be able to generate test specs correctly
    Examples:
      | test_cases |
      | Complete test cases |
      | Incomplete test cases |
      | Invalid test cases |

Feature: Non-Functional Testing
  Scenario Outline: System Performance
    Given the system is under high load or stress conditions "<conditions>"
    When the system operates under these conditions
    Then the system should be able to handle these conditions without significant performance degradation
    Examples:
      | conditions |
      | High loads |
      | Extremely high loads |

  Scenario Outline: API Response Time
    Given the system has API requests "<requests>"
    When the system processes these requests
    Then the APIs should return responses within an acceptable time frame as per the API specifications
    Examples:
      | requests |
      | Regular data |
      | Large amounts of data |

  Scenario Outline: System Security
    Given the system is exposed to various security threats or attacks "<threats>"
