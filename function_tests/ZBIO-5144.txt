FUNCTIONAL TEST CASE:
Functional Test Cases:
--------------------------

1. Test Case: Verify the functionality of the API endpoints exposed at HSBC Developer Portal.
   - Input: API endpoints URL
   - Expected Output: API should return the correct response based on the API specifications.
   - Edge Case: API should handle invalid or unexpected input and return appropriate error messages.

2. Test Case: Verify the functionality of source code in the provided repository.
   - Input: Source code
   - Expected Output: Source code should compile without errors and execute as expected according to the requirements.
   - Edge Case: Source code should handle exceptions and errors gracefully, with clear and informative error messages.

3. Test Case: Verify the functionality of Cards - Collections & Recovery in Green Field development.
   - Input: User actions to trigger card collection and recovery processes
   - Expected Output: The system should correctly process the card collection and recovery actions according to the business rules.
   - Edge Case: The system should handle invalid or unexpected user inputs and return appropriate error messages.

Non-Functional Test Cases:
-----------------------------

1. Test Case: Verify the performance of the API endpoints exposed at HSBC Developer Portal.
   - Input: API endpoints URL
   - Expected Output: API should respond within an acceptable time frame under normal and peak loads.
   - Edge Case: API should be able to handle high traffic and not crash.

2. Test Case: Verify the scalability of the source code in the provided repository.
   - Input: Source code
   - Expected Output: The application should be able to scale and handle an increased load.
   - Edge Case: The application should not crash or become unresponsive under high load.

3. Test Case: Verify the security of the API endpoints exposed at HSBC Developer Portal.
   - Input: API endpoints URL
   - Expected Output: API should not expose sensitive data and should have measures to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Edge Case: API should handle malicious attacks such as SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), etc.

4. Test Case: Validate the reliability of the Cards - Collections & Recovery functionality in Green Field development.
   - Input: User actions to trigger card collection and recovery processes
   - Expected Output: The system should reliably process the card collection and recovery actions without any failures.
   - Edge Case: The system should be able to recover from failures without losing data or causing inconsistencies.
