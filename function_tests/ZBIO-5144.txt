FUNCTIONAL TEST CASE:
Functional Test Cases:
--------------------------
1. Test Case for React JS Components:
   - Input: Different React JS components used in the application.
   - Expected Result: The components should render correctly and perform their defined functions without any errors.
   - Edge Case: Test with invalid or incomplete component props.

2. Test Case for User Interaction with React JS Components:
   - Input: Different user interactions like clicking a button, filling a form, navigating through the application.
   - Expected Result: The application should respond correctly to the user interactions and the state of the components should update correctly.
   - Edge Case: Test with unexpected user interactions or invalid input data.

3. Test Case for Data Fetching in React JS Components:
   - Input: APIs used by React JS components to fetch data.
   - Expected Result: The components should correctly fetch data from the APIs and render the data in the UI.
   - Edge Case: Test with APIs returning error responses or slow network conditions.

4. Test Case for React JS Component Lifecycle:
   - Input: Different lifecycle stages of React JS components.
   - Expected Result: The components should correctly go through their lifecycle stages and perform the associated actions.
   - Edge Case: Test with components unmounting unexpectedly or error conditions during lifecycle stages.

Non-Functional Test Cases:
------------------------------

1. Test Case for React JS Application Performance:
   - Input: High load conditions with multiple components rendering and updating simultaneously.
   - Expected Result: The application should maintain a smooth performance without any noticeable lags or jitters in the UI.
   - Edge Case: Test with extremely high loads that may cause performance degradation.

2. Test Case for React JS Application Responsiveness:
   - Input: Different screen sizes and orientations.
   - Expected Result: The application should correctly adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, maintaining a consistent UI and UX.
   - Edge Case: Test with extremely small or large screen sizes.

3. Test Case for React JS Application Security:
   - Input: Various security threats like XSS, CSRF, etc.
   - Expected Result: The application should be resistant to these security threats and not allow any security breaches.
   - Edge Case: Test with sophisticated security attacks that attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities.

4. Test Case for React JS Application Accessibility:
   - Input: Different accessibility tools and features used by people with disabilities.
   - Expected Result: The application should be accessible and usable with these tools and features.
   - Edge Case: Test with uncommon or rarely used accessibility tools.
