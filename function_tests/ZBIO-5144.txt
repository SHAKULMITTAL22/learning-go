* The application is developed using React JS
* DevOps is Jenkins pipeline
* CI/CD model preferred is Jenkins 

TESTING TYPES IN SCOPE

* Functional, Unit, Integration

PoC TRACKS

Track 1- Existing Applications:

* Repository details – will be provided by the team. This would include source code and pointer to, requirements, any logs

Track 1- Green Field development

* Functionality of our choice. We can pick the area of User Registration
* Enable TDD by first delivering  Functional Test Cases from Requirements, then include Source Code to deliver test specs generation – enriched now with what is in the source code

GHERKIN FILE :
Feature: React JS Components Testing
  As a QA engineer
  I want to test each React JS component
  So that I can ensure the application is working as expected

Scenario Outline: Test React JS Component
  Given I have a "<component>" to test
  When I render the "<component>"
  Then the "<component>" should render without errors

Examples:
  | component   |
  | "User Registration" |
