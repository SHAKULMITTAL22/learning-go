FUNCTIONAL TEST CASES

1. Test Case: Validate the React component rendering
   - Input: Load the application
   - Expected Output: All components should render as expected without any errors
   - Edge Case: Try loading the application with slow network speed and verify the components are still rendering correctly

2. Test Case: Validate the state updates in React component
   - Input: Perform an action that should change the state of a component (e.g., click a button)
   - Expected Output: Component's state should be updated as per the action performed
   - Edge Case: Try performing an action that should not change the state and verify that the state remains unchanged

3. Test Case: Validate the props passing between React components
   - Input: Pass props from a parent component to a child component
   - Expected Output: Child component should receive and use the props as expected
   - Edge Case: Try passing invalid or unexpected props and verify that the child component handles it correctly

NON-FUNCTIONAL TEST CASES

1. Test Case: Validate the application load time
   - Input: Load the application
   - Expected Output: Application should load within acceptable time limits
   - Edge Case: Try loading the application with slow network speed and verify the load time

2. Test Case: Validate the application responsiveness
   - Input: Use the application on different screen sizes
   - Expected Output: Application should respond and adapt to different screen sizes without any issues
   - Edge Case: Try using the application on extremely small or large screen sizes and verify the responsiveness

3. Test Case: Validate the application's browser compatibility
   - Input: Use the application on different browsers
   - Expected Output: Application should work as expected on all supported browsers
   - Edge Case: Try using the application on unsupported browsers and verify the compatibility

4. Test Case: Validate the application's performance under high load
   - Input: Simulate multiple users using the application simultaneously
   - Expected Output: Application should handle the load without crashing or slowing down significantly
   - Edge Case: Try simulating an extremely high number of users to identify the breaking point of the application.
