Feature: React JS Components Testing
  As a QA engineer
  I want to ensure that all the React JS components used in the application are rendering correctly and performing their defined functions

Scenario Outline: Test React JS Components
  Given the React JS components are "<components>"
  When the components are rendered
  Then the components should perform their defined functions without any errors
  But when tested with invalid or incomplete component props
  Then it should throw an appropriate error

Examples:
| components |
| Component1 |
| Component2 |
| Component3 |
| Component4 |

Scenario Outline: Test User Interaction with React JS Components
  Given the user performs "<user_interactions>"
  When the user interacts with the application
  Then the application should respond correctly and the state of the components should update correctly
  But when tested with unexpected interactions or invalid input data
  Then it should handle the invalid interactions gracefully

Examples:
| user_interactions |
| Clicking a button |
| Filling a form    |
| Navigation        |

Scenario Outline: Test Data Fetching in React JS Components
  Given the APIs used by React JS components to fetch data are "<APIs>"
  When the components fetch data from the APIs
  Then the components should correctly render the data in the UI
  But when tested with APIs returning error responses or slow network conditions
  Then it should handle the error responses gracefully and show appropriate error messages

Examples:
| APIs       |
| API1       |
| API2       |
| API3       |

Scenario Outline: Test React JS Component Lifecycle
  Given the lifecycle stages of React JS components are "<lifecycle_stages>"
  When the components go through their lifecycle stages
  Then the components should perform the associated actions correctly
  But when tested with components unmounting unexpectedly or error conditions during lifecycle stages
  Then it should handle the unexpected conditions gracefully and not crash the application

Examples:
| lifecycle_stages |
| Mounting         |
| Updating         |
| Unmounting       |

Feature: Non-Functional Testing of React JS Application

Scenario Outline: Test React JS Application Performance
  Given high load conditions with multiple components rendering and updating simultaneously
  When the application is tested under these conditions
  Then the application should maintain a smooth performance without any noticeable lags or jitters in the UI
  But when tested with extremely high loads that may cause performance degradation
  Then it should handle the high loads gracefully and not crash the application

Scenario Outline: Test React JS Application Responsiveness
  Given different screen sizes and orientations are "<screen_sizes>"
  When the application is tested under these conditions
  Then the application should correctly adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, maintaining a consistent UI and UX
  But when tested with extremely small or large screen sizes
  Then it should handle the extreme screen sizes gracefully and not distort the UI

Examples:
| screen_sizes |
| Small        |
| Medium       |
| Large        |

Scenario Outline: Test React JS Application Security
  Given various security threats like XSS, CSRF, etc
  When the application is tested against these threats
  Then the application should be resistant to these security threats and not allow any security breaches
  But when tested with sophisticated security attacks that attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities
  Then it should handle the sophisticated attacks gracefully and not allow any security breaches

Scenario Outline: Test React JS Application Accessibility
  Given different accessibility tools and features used by people with disabilities
  When the application is tested with these tools and features
  Then the application should be accessible and usable with these tools and features
  But when tested with uncommon or rarely used accessibility tools
  Then it should handle the uncommon tools gracefully and still be accessible and usable
