Before creating the functional test case, let's understand the concept. Functional testing is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose is to check whether your product meets the intended functional specifications and involves black box testing.

To create a functional test case, we would need the following:

1. Test Case ID: Unique identifier for each test case.
2. Test Case Description: Detailed information about what needs to be tested.
3. Precondition: Requirements or conditions that must be met before the test can be run.
4. Test Steps: Detailed steps to follow to execute the test.
5. Test Data: Any necessary data needed for testing.
6. Expected Result: The expected outcome of the test.
7. Actual Result: The actual outcome of the test.
8. Status: Pass or Fail.
9. Post Condition: The final state of the software after the test has been run.
10. Comments: Any additional information or issues encountered during testing.

Here's an example of a functional test case:

Test Case ID: TC001

Test Case Description: Test the login functionality.

Precondition: The user must have a valid username and password.

Test Steps:
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the valid username in the username field.
3. Enter the valid password in the password field.
4. Click the 'Login' button.

Test Data: 
Username: TestUser
Password: Test@123

Expected Result: The user should be successfully logged in and the dashboard should appear.

Actual Result: To be filled after test execution.

Status: To be filled after test execution.

Post Condition: User is logged in and dashboard is displayed.

Comments: To be filled after test execution.
