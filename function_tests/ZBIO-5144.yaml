This YAML file represents a Swagger file, which is a format for describing REST APIs. In this case, the Swagger file describes the base URL, paths, HTTP methods, responses, and other details of the API endpoints mentioned in the Gherkin scenarios. The Swagger file is structured and easy to read, making it a useful tool for both developing and testing APIs.
