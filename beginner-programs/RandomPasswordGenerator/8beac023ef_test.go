  {
    "vulnerability": "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)",
    "issue": "The use of `math/rand` for password generation is not cryptographically secure, meaning the generated passwords may be predictable, leading to an increased risk of brute-force attacks.",
    "solution": "Replace `math/rand` with `crypto/rand` to generate cryptographically secure random numbers. For each character in the password, read a random byte and use it to index the character set."
  },
  {
    "vulnerability": "CWE-337: Predictable Seed in Pseudo-Random Number Generator",
    "issue": "Seeding `math/rand` with the current time (`time.Now().UnixNano()`) is predictable. An attacker who knows the time of password generation can reproduce the same sequence of 'random' numbers.",
    "solution": "Use `crypto/rand` as mentioned previously, which does not require a seed and provides better randomness as it relies on system and hardware entropy sources."
  },
  {
    "vulnerability": "CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt",
    "issue": "The generated passwords do not include a salt value, which would add additional unpredictability to passwords, even when the same password is generated multiple times.",
    "solution": "Include a cryptographically secure random salt as part of the password or the password creation process, and store the salt alongside the password if necessary."

Based on the provided `generator.go` code, here are meaningful test scenarios for the `generatePassword` function:

Scenario 1: ValidPasswordGeneration
Details:
  TestName: TestGeneratePasswordWithValidLength
  Description: This test examines the `generatePassword` function by providing a valid length for the password and checking that a password of that length is indeed generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the password length (e.g., 10 characters).
  Act: Call `generatePassword(length)` with the defined password length.
  Assert: Use `len()` to confirm that the returned password matches the specified length, and `t.Errorf()` to report discrepancies.
Validation:
  Justify: The password length is a crucial parameter, and the output must match it exactly to meet the security criteria.
  Importance: Ensuring that the function can produce a password of a specific length is vital for its usability.

Scenario 2: NonPositiveLength
Details:
  TestName: TestGeneratePasswordWithNonPositiveLength
  Description: The test aims to ensure that the `generatePassword` function handles non-positive lengths properly, perhaps by generating an empty string or reporting an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a non-positive length (e.g., 0 or -1).
  Act: Invoke `generatePassword(length)` with the non-positive length.
  Assert: Expect an empty string as output or check for an error condition if implemented.
Validation:
  Justify: Non-positive lengths are invalid input, and the function's behavior in this case should be predictable and safe.
  Importance: It is essential to check that the function handles invalid input gracefully, avoiding unexpected behavior.

Scenario 3: PasswordComplexity
Details:
  TestName: TestGeneratePasswordComplexity
  Description: Validates that the generated password contains a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters).
Execution:
  Arrange: Specify a password length that ensures that all character types can be included (e.g., 10).
  Act: Invoke `generatePassword(length)` and capture the password.
  Assert: Use character class matching (regex) to validate the presence of different character types within the password.
Validation:
  Justify: Password must meet complexity requirements for secure applications.
  Importance: The test confirms that the function adheres to security standards by including a diverse set of characters.

Scenario 4: Randomness
Details:
  TestName: TestGeneratePasswordRandomness
  Description: Checks if multiple invocations of `generatePassword` produce different results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a password length and generate a set of passwords by calling the function multiple times.
  Act: Store the generated passwords in a slice or array.
  Assert: Compare the generated passwords to ensure they are unique.
Validation:
  Justify: The randomness of password generation is critical to the security of the passwords.
  Importance: It is essential to verify that the `generatePassword` function produces unique and unpredictable passwords.

---

These scenarios provide a comprehensive examination of the `generatePassword` function, ensuring its reliable behavior in generating secure passwords. Each scenario is designed to validate crucial aspects of the function's operation and enforce the application's security requirements.
