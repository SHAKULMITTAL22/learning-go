================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The password length passed to the generatePassword function is not validated, potentially leading to short or excessively long passwords.
Solution: Add input validation to ensure the password length is within a reasonable range (e.g., 10-64 characters).

Vulnerability: CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator
Issue: The rand package is used for generating random numbers, which may not provide sufficient entropy for cryptographic applications.
Solution: Replace the rand package with the crypto/rand package, which is more suitable for cryptographic operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The generated password does not enforce a minimum number of uppercase, lowercase, digit, or special characters, making it easier to brute-force.
Solution: Enforce a minimum number of required character types (e.g., at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit, and one special character).

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Generate a password with the minimum length

   Details:
     Description: This test checks the generatePassword function to ensure it can create a password with the minimum length of 4 characters, consisting of a digit, a special character, and two randomly selected characters.
   Execution:
     Arrange: 
       - No specific data setup is required.
     Act:
       - Call generatePassword(4)
     Assert:
       - Verify that the generated string has a length of 4.

   Validation:
     The choice of assertion is based on verifying the function's ability to generate a password with the minimum length. This test is essential to ensure that the function correctly handles the minimum length restriction.

2. Scenario: Generate a password with the maximum length

   Details:
     Description: This test checks the generatePassword function to ensure it can create a password with the maximum length of 64 characters, consisting of a digit, a special character, and sixty-two randomly selected characters.
   Execution:
     Arrange:
       - No specific data setup is required.
     Act:
       - Call generatePassword(64)
     Assert:
       - Verify that the generated string has a length of 64.

   Validation:
     The choice of assertion is based on verifying the function's ability to generate a password with the maximum length. This test is essential to ensure that the function correctly handles the maximum length restriction.

---

3. Scenario: Generate a password with a length of 10

   Details:
     Description: This test checks the generatePassword function to ensure it can create a password of 10 characters, consisting of a digit, a special character, and eight randomly selected characters.
   Execution:
     Arrange:
       - No specific data setup is required.
     Act:
       - Call generatePassword(10)
     Assert:
       - Verify that the generated string has a length of 10.

   Validation:
     The choice of assertion is based on verifying the function's ability to generate a password with a specific length within the minimum and maximum limits. This test is essential to ensure that the function correctly handles the desired length.

---

4. Scenario: Generate a password with invalid length

   Details:
     Description: This test checks the generatePassword function to ensure it returns an error when the length is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum.
   Execution:
     Arrange:
       - No specific data setup is required.
     Act:
       - Call generatePassword(-1) or generatePassword(65)
     Assert:
       - Verify that an error is returned for the negative length and for length greater than 64.

   Validation:
     The choice of assertion is based on verifying the function's error handling capability. This test is essential to ensure that the function correctly handles invalid length inputs.

---

5. Scenario: Generate a password with different seeds

   Details:
     Description: This test checks the generatePassword function to ensure it can generate different passwords with the same length and different seeds.
   Execution:
     Arrange:
       - Set different seeds for the rand package.
     Act:
       - Call generatePassword(10) with different seeds.
     Assert:
       - Verify that the generated strings are different for different seeds.

   Validation:
     The choice of assertion is based on verifying the function's ability to generate different passwords with different seeds. This test is essential to ensure that the function correctly handles different seeds and generates unique passwords.
