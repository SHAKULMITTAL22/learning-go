================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Inadequate Encryption Strength
Issue: The current password generation algorithm uses a predictable seed based on the current time, which could be exploited by an attacker to guess the generated passwords.
Solution: Use a cryptographically secure random number generator, such as crypto/rand, to seed the random number generator. Additionally, consider increasing the password length and complexity to further enhance security.

Vulnerability: CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
Issue: The math/rand package is used for generating random numbers, which is not cryptographically secure and could be predictable.
Solution: Replace the use of the math/rand package with the crypto/rand package, which provides a cryptographically secure random number generator. This will ensure that the generated numbers are truly random and cannot be easily predicted.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Password Generation with a Valid Length

Details:
Description: This test checks the generatePassword function's behavior when given a valid input length, ensuring a properly formatted password is generated.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the length parameter to a valid integer, for example, 12.
Act: Call the generatePassword function with the provided length.
Assert: Verify that the generated password is of the correct length and contains at least one digit, one special character, and the remaining characters are from the allowed set.
Validation:
The assertion checks the length and composition of the generated password, ensuring the function behaves as expected. This test is essential for verifying the normal operation of the password generation functionality.

Scenario 2: Test Password Generation with a Minimum Length

Details:
Description: This test checks the generatePassword function's behavior when given the minimum allowed length, ensuring a properly formatted password is generated.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the length parameter to the minimum allowed length, for example, 6.
Act: Call the generatePassword function with the provided length.
Assert: Verify that the generated password is of the correct length and contains at least one digit, one special character, and the remaining characters are from the allowed set.
Validation:
The assertion checks the length and composition of the generated password, ensuring the function behaves as expected even when given the minimum allowed length.

Scenario 3: Test Password Generation with a Maximum Length

Details:
Description: This test checks the generatePassword function's behavior when given the maximum allowed length, ensuring a properly formatted password is generated.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the length parameter to the maximum allowed length, for example, 64.
Act: Call the generatePassword function with the provided length.
Assert: Verify that the generated password is of the correct length and contains at least one digit, one special character, and the remaining characters are from the allowed set.
Validation:
The assertion checks the length and composition of the generated password, ensuring the function behaves as expected even when given the maximum allowed length.

Scenario 4: Test Password Generation with a Length of Zero

Details:
Description: This test checks the generatePassword function's behavior when given a length of zero, ensuring a proper error is returned.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the length parameter to zero.
Act: Call the generatePassword function with the provided length.
Assert: Verify that the function returns an error indicating the length must be greater than zero.
Validation:
The assertion checks for the presence of an error, ensuring the function handles invalid input gracefully.

Scenario 5: Test Password Generation with a Negative Length

Details:
Description: This test checks the generatePassword function's behavior when given a negative length, ensuring a proper error is returned.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the length parameter to a negative integer, for example, -1.
Act: Call the generatePassword function with the provided length.
Assert: Verify that the function returns an error indicating the length must be greater than zero.
Validation:
The assertion checks for the presence of an error, ensuring the function handles invalid input gracefully.

Scenario 6: Test Password Generation with a Large Length

Details:
Description: This test checks the generatePassword function's behavior when given a very large length, ensuring it doesn't cause an out-of-memory error.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the length parameter to a very large integer, for example, 1000000.
Act: Call the generatePassword function with the provided length.
Assert: Verify that the function doesn't cause an out-of-memory error or hang indefinitely.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the function behaves properly even when given extreme input values, ensuring the stability and reliability of the application.
