ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=generatePassword_24386dfbfc

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The function uses math/rand for generating random numbers which is not cryptographically secure and can produce predictable values if the seed is known.
Solution: Replace math/rand with crypto/rand package for generating cryptographically secure random numbers.

Vulnerability: Hardcoded Credential Entropy
Issue: Password length is hardcoded and lacks validation against minimum security requirements, which may result in weak passwords.
Solution: Implement password complexity and minimum length requirements. Allow the function to receive these parameters as input and validate them.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Randomness in Initial Characters
Issue: The first two characters of the password are chosen from a limited set (digits and specials), reducing the entropy for those positions.
Solution: Randomly choose all characters from the combined set without giving preference to specific character types for certain positions.

================================================================================
and Uniqueness Over Multiple Invocations

Details:
  TestName: TestGeneratePasswordRandomnessAndUniqueness
  Description: This test verifies that multiple invocations of `generatePassword` result in distinct passwords to ensure the randomness of password generation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Call `generatePassword` with a fixed length multiple times (e.g., 10 times).
  Act: Store each generated password in a collection.
  Assert: Assert that all passwords in the collection are unique.
Validation:
  Justify: This test ensures that the password generation is not deterministic and that the function produces a unique password on each call, a critical aspect of password security.
  Importance: This test is fundamental for validating the security aspect of the password generator, as predictable or repeatable passwords could be exploited.

---

**Scenario 5**: Edge Case with Zero Length

Details:
  TestName: TestGeneratePasswordWithZeroLength
  Description: This test examines the `generatePassword` function's resilience to an edge case where the requested password length is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Specify a password length of 0.
  Act: Invoke `generatePassword` with the length of 0.
  Assert: Assert that an empty string is returned.
Validation:
  Justify: The function should handle edge cases gracefully. Returning an empty string is appropriate behavior for a password length of 0.
  Importance: Validates that the function has safeguard handling for nonsensical input that could otherwise cause undefined behavior or errors.

---

**Scenario 6**: Negative Length Input for Error Handling

Details:
  TestName: TestGeneratePasswordWithNegativeLength
  Description: This scenario checks the `generatePassword` function's behavior when provided with an invalid negative length input to see how it handles error conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a negative password length, like -1.
  Act: Invoke `generatePassword` with the negative length.
  Assert: In Go, returning an error is a common approach; however, since the function doesn't currently have error handling, assert that the function returns an empty string or update the function to return an error and assert that it does so.
Validation:
  Justify: Input validation is a critical part of software robustness, and handling negative lengths is part of defensive programming practices.
  Importance: Ensures robust input validation, preventing potential vulnerabilities or crashes that may arise from incorrect usage.

---

These scenarios cover a gamut of regular operations, edge cases, and possible error handling that the `generatePassword` function might encounter. They collectively ensure that the function behaves as expected, produces secure passwords, and gracefully handles improper input.

// Add more test cases here as necessary.

// Note: The current implementation of generatePassword does not handle negative lengths gracefully;

// source code by adding proper error handling and then updating the test accordingly.
