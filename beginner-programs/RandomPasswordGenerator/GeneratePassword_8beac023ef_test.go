================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Insufficient Entropy in Random Values Generation (CWE-331)
Issue: The password generation relies on the math/rand package, which is not suitable for generating cryptographically secure random numbers. An attacker may predict the output of rand.Intn, leading to predictable passwords.
Solution: Use crypto/rand package for generating cryptographically secure random numbers. crypto/rand uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) and it is safe for generating passwords.

Vulnerability:Insecure Randomness (CWE-330)
Issue: The seed for the pseudorandom number generator is time.Now().UnixNano(). This can lead to predictable randomness as the granularity of UnixNano is not sufficient to provide unique seeds for concurrent or near-simultaneous operations.
Solution: Use crypto/rand to generate a unique seed for the pseudorandom number generator.

Vulnerability:Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798)
Issue: The code uses hard-coded character sets for password generation. This limits the randomness and makes the password predictable.
Solution: Consider an external and secure source for your character sets.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Password Length
Test that the length of the generated password matches the input length. If you input a length of 10, the generated password should be 10 characters long.

2. Scenario: Password Uniqueness
Test that the generated passwords are unique. If you call the function multiple times, it should return a different password each time.

3. Scenario: Password Complexity
Test that the generated password always contains at least one digit, one special character, and one letter. This tests the complexity requirements of the password.

4. Scenario: Password Randomness
Test that the password is not predictable. You can do this by generating a large number of passwords and checking that the distribution of characters is roughly equal.

5. Scenario: Negative Length Input
Test what happens if you provide a negative length. The function should either return an error or a password of length 0.

6. Scenario: Zero Length Input
Test that if you provide a length of 0, the function returns an empty string.

7. Scenario: Special Characters Inclusion
Test that the generated password includes characters from the defined "specials" string. 

8. Scenario: Digits Inclusion
Test that the generated password includes characters from the defined "digits" string.

9. Scenario: Large Length Input
Test the function with a very large length input. This will help identify any potential performance issues.

10. Scenario: Non-integer Length Input
Test what happens if you provide a non-integer length. The function should either return an error or handle the input appropriately.
