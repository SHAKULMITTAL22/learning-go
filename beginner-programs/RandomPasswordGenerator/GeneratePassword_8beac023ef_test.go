================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability:Insufficient Entropy in Random Values Generation
Issue: The function `generatePassword` uses `math/rand` for generating random values which is a pseudorandom number generator and not suitable for generating secure random values.
Solution: Use `crypto/rand` package instead of `math/rand` for generating secure random values. This package generates random numbers from sources that are suitable for cryptographic usage.

Vulnerability:Predictable Seed in the Pseudorandom Number Generator
Issue: The function `generatePassword` seeds the pseudorandom number generator with current timestamp using `time.Now().UnixNano()`. This could lead to predictable randomness as the resolution of `UnixNano` is 1 second.
Solution: Avoid seeding the pseudorandom number generator with time-dependent values. If using `math/rand` is inevitable, consider using a more complex seeding process.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Password Length
Test that the length of the generated password matches the input length. If you input a length of 10, the function should return a password of exactly 10 characters.

2. Scenario: Password Content
Test that the generated password contains at least one digit and one special character. This is based on the fact that the function is designed to include at least one digit and one special character in every password.

3. Scenario: Password Randomness
Test that two passwords generated in succession are not the same. This tests the randomness of the password generation process.

4. Scenario: Password Length Limit
Test that the function can handle generating a password of maximum length (for example, 1000 characters). This tests the function's ability to handle large inputs.

5. Scenario: Password Length Zero
Test that the function can handle generating a password of zero length. The function should return an empty string in this case.

6. Scenario: Password Length Negative
Test that the function can handle generating a password with a negative length. The function should return an error or handle this input in a defined way.

7. Scenario: Password Characters
Test that the generated password contains only valid characters. The password should only contain characters from the "all" string.

8. Scenario: Password Shuffle
Test that the first two characters of the password (which are initially a digit and a special character) are not always at the beginning of the password. This tests the shuffling functionality of the function.

9. Scenario: Password Generation Speed
Test the speed of password generation. The function should be able to generate a password in a reasonable amount of time, even for larger passwords.

10. Scenario: Password Consistency
Test that the function generates the same password given the same seed. This is to ensure the function's consistency.
