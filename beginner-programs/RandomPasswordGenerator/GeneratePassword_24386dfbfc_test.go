ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=generatePassword_24386dfbfc

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The use of `rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())` for password generation is predictable and can lead to generating passwords that could be guessed or brute-forced by an attacker who knows the time of password generation.
Solution: Use `crypto/rand` package for generating passwords to ensure that the generated values are cryptographically secure. Replace `math/rand` with `crypto/rand` and adjust the code to use cryptographically secure random number generation.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: Although not directly shown in the snippet, if passwords generated by this function are stored, the lack of salting can make them vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.
Solution: Ensure that passwords are hashed with a unique salt before storage. Use a library designed for secure password storage, such as `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`, which automatically handles salting.

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Basic Password Generation

Details:
  TestName: TestGeneratePasswordBasic
  Description: This test checks if the `generatePassword` function generates a password of the requested length, ensuring basic functionality works as expected.

Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangements needed beyond choosing a password length.
  Act: Invoke `generatePassword` with a specific length, e.g., 10.
  Assert: Verify that the returned string is exactly 10 characters long.

Validation:
  The assertion checks the length of the output to ensure it matches the input parameter. This test is crucial as it validates the core functionality of the password generator, ensuring it respects the user's request for password length.

### Scenario 2: Password Contains Digits and Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: TestPasswordComposition
  Description: Ensures that the generated password contains at least one digit and one special character, as per the function's design.

Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a password length, ensuring it's more than 2 to accommodate the initial digit and special character requirements.
  Act: Invoke `generatePassword` with the chosen length.
  Assert: Check if the returned password contains at least one digit and one special character from the predefined sets.

Validation:
  This assertion confirms the function's compliance with its design to include different character sets for security. This test is vital for assessing the password's strength and adherence to common security practices.

### Scenario 3: Validate Randomness of Password

Details:
  TestName: TestPasswordRandomness
  Description: Validates that consecutive password generations result in different outputs, ensuring the randomness of the password generation.

Execution:
  Arrange: Specify a password length.
  Act: Invoke `generatePassword` twice with the same length.
  Assert: Verify that the two generated passwords are not identical.

Validation:
  By asserting that two consecutive invocations produce different results, this test evaluates the function's ability to generate random and unique passwords, a key aspect of password security. It's important to ensure that the password generator does not produce predictable or easily guessable outcomes.

### Scenario 4: Edge Case with Minimum Length

Details:
  TestName: TestMinimumLengthPassword
  Description: Tests the function's behavior when the minimum possible length (2) is requested, which is the edge case for ensuring the inclusion of both a digit and a special character.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set the password length to 2.
  Act: Invoke `generatePassword` with this length.
  Assert: Check that the password is exactly 2 characters long and includes one digit and one special character.

Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle its lower boundary condition correctly. The assertion verifies both the length and composition of the password, ensuring the function's robustness and adherence to its specifications even in edge cases.

### Scenario 5: Handling of Invalid Length

Details:
  TestName: TestInvalidPasswordLength
  Description: Checks how the function behaves when given an invalid length, such as a negative number, which is not supported by the function's design.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set the password length to a negative number, e.g., -1.
  Act: Attempt to invoke `generatePassword` with this length.
  Assert: This scenario requires a decision on the expected behavior, whether it throws an error, returns an empty string, or defaults to a minimum length. Since the function does not currently handle errors, the expected behavior needs to be defined.

Validation:
  This test is crucial for error handling and input validation. It's important to ensure that the application behaves predictably and securely in the face of invalid input, protecting against potential misuse or errors in upstream code. 

(Note: The last scenario requires modification to the original function to either handle errors or define a specific behavior for invalid input, as Go's current implementation does not inherently support exceptions.)
