Scenario 1: Valid Blog Deletion

Details:
  Description: In this scenario, a valid blog ID will be provided to the DeleteBlog function. The function should successfully delete the blog from the database and return a response with the status set to true. The success criteria for this test would be a correct response with a status set to true.

Scenario 2: Blog Deletion with Non-existing Blog ID

Details:
  Description: In this scenario, a non-existing blog ID will be provided to the DeleteBlog function. The function should return an error stating that the blog could not be found or deleted. The success criteria for this test would be a correct error response stating that the blog could not be found or deleted.

Scenario 3: Blog Deletion with Invalid Blog ID Format

Details:
  Description: In this scenario, a blog ID with an invalid format will be provided to the DeleteBlog function. The function should return an error stating that the blog ID could not be converted to an ObjectId. The success criteria for this test would be a correct error response stating that the blog ID could not be converted to an ObjectId.

Scenario 4: Blog Deletion with Null Blog ID

Details:
  Description: In this scenario, a null blog ID will be provided to the DeleteBlog function. The function should return an error stating that the blog ID could not be converted to an ObjectId. The success criteria for this test would be a correct error response stating that the blog ID could not be converted to an ObjectId.

Scenario 5: Blog Deletion with Empty Blog ID

Details:
  Description: In this scenario, an empty blog ID will be provided to the DeleteBlog function. The function should return an error stating that the blog ID could not be converted to an ObjectId. The success criteria for this test would be a correct error response stating that the blog ID could not be converted to an ObjectId. 

Scenario 6: Blog Deletion under Load

Details:
  Description: In this scenario, the DeleteBlog function will be called multiple times in a short time frame to simulate heavy load. The function should handle the load gracefully and return the correct responses. The success criteria for this test would be the correct responses and no server crashes or slowdowns under heavy load.
