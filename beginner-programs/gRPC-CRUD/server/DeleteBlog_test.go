ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=DeleteBlog_4e19addbc8

Here are test scenarios for the `DeleteBlog` function, focusing on various aspects such as normal operation, edge cases, and error handling.

### Scenario 1: Valid Deletion of an Existing Blog

Details:
  Description: This test checks the successful deletion of an existing blog post using a valid blog ID. 
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Set up a mock MongoDB collection with a blog document that has a specific ObjectId. 
  - Act: Invoke `DeleteBlog` with the correct blog ID in the request. 
  - Assert: Verify that `DeleteOne` is called on the collection and `DeleteBlogResponse` returns a status of true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: The assertion ensures that the blog deletion logic correctly interacts with the database and returns a success status.
  Importance: Validates core functionality as deleting entries is a primary use case of the application.

---

### Scenario 2: Non-existent Blog Deletion

Details:
  Description: To verify the function handles attempts to delete a blog that doesn't exist in the database.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Set up a MongoDB mock where the `DeleteOne` method simulates a not found error.
  - Act: Call `DeleteBlog` with an ID not present in the database.
  - Assert: Confirm that the function returns a `NotFound` error through the gRPC status code.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: Ensures proper error feedback when attempting to delete a non-existent entry.
  Importance: Helps maintain data integrity by handling operations on non-existing data gracefully.

---

### Scenario 3: Invalid Blog ID Format

Details:
  Description: To check the error handling when an invalid blog ID that cannot be converted to an ObjectId is provided.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare a request using an invalid blog ID that cannot be converted to a MongoDB ObjectId (e.g., a malformed string).
  - Act: Call `DeleteBlog` with this malformed ID.
  - Assert: Verify the response has an `InvalidArgument` error with the expected error message.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: Ensures robustness by catching input errors early before any database operation.
  Importance: Prevents unnecessary database interaction and controls user input errors, improving application stability.

---

### Scenario 4: Database Delete Operation Fails

Details:
  Description: This test simulates a failure in the database's deletion operation independent of the input format.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Stub the `DeleteOne` method to return a simulated internal error.
  - Act: Invoke `DeleteBlog` with a valid blog ID request.
  - Assert: Check that the response contains an appropriate `Internal` error status.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: Validates error handling for unexpected operational faults during database transactions.
  Importance: Ensures proper error reporting and handling mechanisms are in place for backend failures.

---

### Scenario 5: Delete Request with Concurrency Concern

Details:
  Description: To observe behavior when multiple delete requests for the same blog ID are executed concurrently.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Initiate multiple concurrent `DeleteBlog` requests with identical Blog IDs.
  - Act: Call `DeleteBlog` simultaneously through goroutines.
  - Assert: Only one request should result in a successful deletion, while others might receive a `NotFound` error.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion: Tests concurrency handling and possible race conditions in delete operations.
  Importance: Ensures the application can handle concurrent modifications gracefully without corrupting system state.

These scenarios aim to provide comprehensive testing of the `DeleteBlog` function, covering both typical usage and potential edge cases or errors that need to be handled.
