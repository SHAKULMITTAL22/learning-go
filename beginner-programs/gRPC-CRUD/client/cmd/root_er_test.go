FUNCTION_DEF=func er(msg interface)
Okay, here are test scenarios for the `er` function, keeping in mind its behavior (printing and exiting) and the provided context. Since the function calls `os.Exit(1)`, direct testing within the same process is problematic. These scenarios assume a testing approach that can handle this, such as running the function in a subprocess and checking its output and exit code.

```
Scenario 1: Basic String Message

Details:
  Description: Test the `er` function with a standard, non-empty string message. This verifies the core functionality of printing the "Error: " prefix followed by the provided message and exiting with code 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a simple string variable, e.g., `errMsg := "Something went wrong"`.
  Act: Call `er(errMsg)`. This action would typically be executed in a separate process for testing purposes.
  Assert:
    1. Verify that the standard output captured from the subprocess contains the exact string "Error: Something went wrong\n".
    2. Verify that the subprocess exited with a status code of 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: We assert the exact output string because the function's primary visible effect (besides exiting) is printing to stdout. The expected exit code `1` is explicitly defined in the function's `os.Exit(1)` call, signifying an error state.
  Discuss the importance of the test: This is the most common use case for an error-reporting function. Ensuring it correctly formats the output and signals an error via the exit code is fundamental.

```

```
Scenario 2: Error Type Message

Details:
  Description: Test the `er` function with a value of type `error`. This ensures the function correctly handles standard Go error types by printing their string representation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an error object, e.g., `err := fmt.Errorf("database connection failed: %w", io.ErrUnexpectedEOF)`.
  Act: Call `er(err)`. Execute in a separate process.
  Assert:
    1. Verify that the standard output contains "Error: " followed by the result of `err.Error()` and a newline (e.g., "Error: database connection failed: unexpected EOF\n").
    2. Verify that the subprocess exited with a status code of 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `fmt.Println` automatically calls the `Error()` method when printing an `error` interface value. The assertion checks that this conversion happens correctly and the standard "Error: " prefix and exit code 1 are applied.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Go programs conventionally use the `error` type for error handling. This test ensures the `er` function integrates correctly with this convention.

```

```
Scenario 3: Nil Input

Details:
  Description: Test the `er` function when passed a `nil` value. This checks the behavior for nil inputs passed via the `interface{}` parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific data arrangement needed, the input is `nil`.
  Act: Call `er(nil)`. Execute in a separate process.
  Assert:
    1. Verify that the standard output contains "Error: <nil>\n". (`fmt.Println` prints `<nil>` for a nil interface value).
    2. Verify that the subprocess exited with a status code of 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks `fmt.Println`'s specific handling of `nil` interface values. Even with nil input, the function should still signal an error condition by exiting with code 1.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Passing `nil` accidentally is a potential bug source. This test ensures the function handles it gracefully (doesn't panic) and still performs its core exit action.

```

```
Scenario 4: Integer Input

Details:
  Description: Test the `er` function with an integer value. This verifies its behavior with non-string, non-error primitive types allowed by `interface{}`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an integer variable, e.g., `errCode := 500`.
  Act: Call `er(errCode)`. Execute in a separate process.
  Assert:
    1. Verify that the standard output contains "Error: 500\n". (`fmt.Println` will convert the integer to its string representation).
    2. Verify that the subprocess exited with a status code of 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: `fmt.Println` handles various types. This test confirms it correctly stringifies integers and that the `er` function's prefixing and exiting logic remains consistent regardless of the input type conforming to `interface{}`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: While less common, passing non-string/error types might occur. This test ensures the function doesn't fail and maintains its primary exit behavior.

```

```
Scenario 5: Struct Pointer Input (Using Provided Context)

Details:
  Description: Test the `er` function with a pointer to one of the defined struct types (e.g., `createBlogCmdParams`). This checks how `fmt.Println` handles custom struct types passed via `interface{}`.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    1. Create an instance of a struct, e.g., `params := &createBlogCmdParams{ID: new(string), Title: new(string)}`.
    2. Optionally assign values: `*params.Title = "Test Title"`.
  Act: Call `er(params)`. Execute in a separate process.
  Assert:
    1. Verify that the standard output contains "Error: " followed by the default string representation of the struct pointer provided by `fmt.Println` (this often includes field names and values, e.g., "Error: &{<nil> 0x... <nil> <nil>}\n" or similar, depending on Go version and exact struct content). The exact format might need adjustment based on observation.
    2. Verify that the subprocess exited with a status code of 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion verifies that `fmt.Println` provides *some* representation of the struct and that the `er` function still prefixes it and exits correctly. The exact struct representation isn't critical, but ensuring it prints *something* and exits is.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Developers might inadvertently pass complex types to `er`. This test ensures the function handles such cases without crashing and still performs its exit duty, even if the printed message isn't perfectly formatted for human reading without a custom `String()` method on the struct.

```

```
Scenario 6: Empty String Input

Details:
  Description: Test the `er` function with an empty string message. This is an edge case for string inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty string variable, `errMsg := ""`.
  Act: Call `er(errMsg)`. Execute in a separate process.
  Assert:
    1. Verify that the standard output contains exactly "Error: \n".
    2. Verify that the subprocess exited with a status code of 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Asserts that the "Error: " prefix is still printed, followed immediately by a newline because the message itself is empty. The exit code must still be 1.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Tests the handling of minimal valid input for the string type, ensuring the function doesn't behave unexpectedly (e.g., omitting the prefix or newline).
