```
Scenario 1: Successfully Creating a Blog with Valid Data

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the CreateBlog function successfully creates a blog when provided with valid data. This test checks that the service correctly processes and returns a successful response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a CreateBlogRequest with a valid Blog object containing an AuthorId, Title, and Content.
  Act: Invoke the CreateBlog gRPC endpoint with the prepared request.
  Assert: Verify that the response contains a Blog object with a valid Id assigned.
Validation:
  Use assertions to confirm that the Blog Id in the response is not empty, indicating successful blog creation.
  This test is crucial for verifying that the core functionality of creating a blog works correctly under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Handling a Blog Creation Request with Missing Title

Details:
  Description: Test how the CreateBlog function handles a blog creation request when the Title field is missing, simulating input validation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CreateBlogRequest where the Blog object has an empty Title but other fields are filled.
  Act: Call the CreateBlog endpoint with the incomplete request.
  Assert: Verify that the service returns a gRPC error with code InvalidArgument.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that proper validation is enforced before processing the request.
  This test is important to ensure robustness against incomplete data submissions.

Scenario 3: Handling a Blog Creation Request with Missing AuthorId

Details:
  Description: Examine how the CreateBlog function responds to a request missing the AuthorId, which is crucial for tying the blog to a specific author.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup a CreateBlogRequest with the Blog object having an empty AuthorId.
  Act: Execute the CreateBlog call using the described request data.
  Assert: Check for an InvalidArgument error from the gRPC service.
Validation:
  Asserting the occurrence of an error ensures that author identification is mandatory for creating a blog.
  This ensures accountability and proper tracking of content authorship in the system.

Scenario 4: Handling a CreateBlog Call with Server Unavailable

Details:
  Description: Verify the CreateBlog function's behavior when the server is unavailable, simulating network or server downtime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a mock gRPC client to simulate the server being down or unresponsive.
  Act: Attempt to call the CreateBlog endpoint.
  Assert: Confirm that a gRPC error with code Unavailable is returned.
Validation:
  Ensure proper error code handling for network or server issues.
  This test highlights the system's resilience to server-side failures, aiding in fault tolerance.

Scenario 5: Creating a Blog with Excessively Large Content

Details:
  Description: Test how the CreateBlog function processes a blog with content that exceeds a typical size limit, assessing performance and limitations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a CreateBlogRequest with a Blog containing an excessively large Content field.
  Act: Call the CreateBlog service endpoint with this oversized request.
  Assert: Verify if the service returns an error or handles the content appropriately.
Validation:
  The test validates the system's capability to handle large payloads without crashing.
  Understanding limits helps in setting maximum content size requirements and preventing buffer overflow issues.

Scenario 6: Duplicate Blog Creation with Same Content

Details:
  Description: Assess the behavior of the CreateBlog function when attempting to create a blog with content identical to an existing one to check for duplicate handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initially, create a blog with specific content. Then, prepare a CreateBlogRequest with the same content.
  Act: Call the CreateBlog endpoint twice with identical content.
  Assert: Check if the second call returns a success or some form of duplicate notification.
Validation:
  The test determines whether duplicate checks are in place and what the expected behavior is.
  It's important for business logic to potentially avoid cluttering with identical content.

Scenario 7: Unauthorized Blog Creation Attempt

Details:
  Description: Test if the CreateBlog function properly restricts access by simulating an unauthorized attempt to create a blog.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the gRPC client without valid authentication credentials.
  Act: Make a request to the CreateBlog endpoint.
  Assert: Ensure that the response contains a gRPC error with permission denied code.
Validation:
  Confirms that security measures are intact, preventing unauthorized blog creation.
  This scenario helps validate access control mechanisms that protect data integrity.
