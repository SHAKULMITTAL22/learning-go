Test generated by RoostGPT for test math-go using AI Type Open AI and AI Model gpt-4

Here are the details of the security checks that were performed on the code, please review them carefully:

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function `IsValidEmail` does not validate the structure of the email, it only checks the length. This could allow invalid emails to pass the validation.
Solution: Use a regular expression to validate the structure of the email. Make sure the regular expression follows the RFC 5322 Official Standard.

Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: The function `IsValidEmail` could potentially process a large amount of data without limit, which may lead to resource exhaustion.
Solution: Implement a limit to the size of the input that the function can process. For example, you could return an error if the input size is larger than a certain threshold.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The function `IsValidEmail` does not check for malicious patterns in the email such as 'www.malicious.com@legit.com'. This could potentially lead to phishing attacks or other security issues.
Solution: Extend your validation to disallow email addresses that contain a '@' in the local part (before the domain).

1. Test Scenario: Valid Email 
   - Description: The function should return true when a valid email is passed.
   - Input: "test@example.com"
   - Expected Output: true

2. Test Scenario: Invalid Email Without '@' Symbol 
   - Description: The function should return false when an email without '@' symbol is passed.
   - Input: "testexample.com"
   - Expected Output: false

3. Test Scenario: Invalid Email Without Domain 
   - Description: The function should return false when an email without domain is passed.
   - Input: "test@"
   - Expected Output: false

4. Test Scenario: Invalid Email with Extra Characters 
   - Description: The function should return false when an email with extra characters is passed.
   - Input: "test@@example.com"
   - Expected Output: false

5. Test Scenario: Invalid Email Length 
   - Description: The function should return false when an email with more than 254 characters is passed.
   - Input: "a"*255 + "@example.com"
   - Expected Output: false

6. Test Scenario: Valid Email with Maximum Length 
   - Description: The function should return true when an email with exactly 254 characters is passed.
   - Input: "a"*246 + "@example.com"
   - Expected Output: true

7. Test Scenario: Empty String
   - Description: The function should return false when an empty string is passed.
   - Input: ""
   - Expected Output: false

8. Test Scenario: Email with Special Characters 
   - Description: The function should return true when an email with special characters is passed.
   - Input: "test.name+alias@example.com"
   - Expected Output: true

9. Test Scenario: Email with Non-English Characters
   - Description: The function should return true when an email with non-English characters is passed.
   - Input: "üñîçøðé@example.com"
   - Expected Output: true

10. Test Scenario: Email with IP Address as Domain
   - Description: The function should return true when an email with IP address as domain is passed.
   - Input: "test@[123.123.123.123]"
   - Expected Output: true
