Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

```markdown
Scenario 1: Test Email with Leading and Trailing Spaces

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles an email address that contains leading or trailing spaces. Since emails with extra spaces should be trimmed or considered invalid, this test ensures accurate validation.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an email string with leading and trailing spaces, such as "  test@example.com  ".
    Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the prepared email.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`, indicating an invalid email.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on the belief that a well-formed email should not include extraneous spaces. This test ensures that the function does not validate emails incorrectly due to white space handling. This is important to enforce consistent email formats across the application.

Scenario 2: Test Email with Consecutive Dots in Local Part

Details:
  Description: The purpose of this test is to ensure that an email address with consecutive dots in the local part, such as "test..example@example.com", is identified as invalid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a test email "test..example@example.com".
    Act: Use the `IsValidEmail` function to validate the email.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns `false`, indicating the email is invalid due to consecutive dots in the local part.
  Validation:
    Consecutive dots are not allowed in the local part of an email address (as per certain email formatting rules). This test checks that the function enforces these rules, maintaining the integrity and standard format of email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test Email with Missing Local Part

Details:
  Description: This scenario focuses on verifying that emails lacking the local part (e.g., "@example.com") are identified as invalid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an email as "@example.com".
    Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with the setup email.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns `false`, marking the email as invalid.
  Validation:
    The correctness of this assertion relies on the fact that a valid email must have a non-empty local part. This test is crucial for preventing attempts to validate incomplete email addresses, ensuring only valid information is accepted.

Scenario 4: Test Email with Invalid Domain Format

Details:
  Description: The aim of this test is to confirm that an email with an invalid domain format, such as "test@-example.com", is marked as invalid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an email "test@-example.com".
    Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the prepared email.
    Assert: Ensure that the function returns `false` due to the invalid domain format.
  Validation:
    The validation logic stems from domain naming conventions that prohibit certain formats like a hyphen at the start of a domain. Enforcing these rules helps maintain a high standard for data validation within applications.

Scenario 5: Test Email with International Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle email addresses with international or Unicode characters properly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an email such as "tést@exámple.com".
    Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this email.
    Assert: Validate the function's output to ensure it handles such input correctly, depending on the accepted rule for Unicode in emails.
  Validation:
    Given increasing globalization, applications often need to support Unicode characters in emails. This test helps ensure that the function can handle or appropriately reject Unicode in line with business requirements.

Scenario 6: Test Email with Reserved Domains

Details:
  Description: The goal is to verify that emails using reserved domain names (e.g., ".example") are treated as invalid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an email such as "user@reserved.example".
    Act: Pass this email into `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`, aligning with standards that exclude these domains from normal usage.
  Validation:
    Since reserved domains are typically used for documentation and not real-world email addresses, this test helps prevent false positive validations for invalid emails, ensuring better data quality.

Scenario 7: Test Email with Valid IP Address

Details:
  Description: Verify that an email address using an IP address as the domain, e.g., "user@[192.168.1.1]", is considered valid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Configure an email using an IP address as the domain.
    Act: Validate using `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: Ensure the function returns `true`, asserting the right recognition of this format.
  Validation:
    An IP-based domain is legitimate per certain email formats. This test is crucial for applications supporting such inputs, ensuring accurate compliance with email standards.

```

These scenarios are crafted to cover various valid and invalid cases not covered by existing tests, ensuring comprehensive validation checks for different email formats.
