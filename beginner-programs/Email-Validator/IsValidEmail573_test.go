Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Here are potential test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function, focusing on scenarios not covered by the pre-existing tests provided:

### Scenario 1: Valid Email with Subdomain

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks if an email containing a subdomain is considered valid. Subdomains are common in business emails and should pass validation.
  
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Prepare an email string with a subdomain (e.g., "user@sub.example.com").
- **Act:** Invoke the `IsValidEmail` function with this email.
- **Assert:** Verify that the function returns `true`.

**Validation:**
- The assertion `true` is expected because emails with subdomains are valid formats.
- This test ensures that emails in business contexts, which often use subdomains, are correctly validated, maintaining application reliability.

### Scenario 2: Email with Consecutive Dots

**Details:**
- **Description:** Verify that an email with consecutive dots before the "@" symbol, which is invalid, returns `false`.
  
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Use an email string like "user..name@example.com".
- **Act:** Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this email.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `false`.

**Validation:**
- Assertion is `false` because consecutive dots in the local part are invalid.
- This test is crucial to enforce proper email formatting and avoid potential errors in user or system communication.

### Scenario 3: Email Starting with Dot

**Details:**
- **Description:** Tests the function handling of emails starting with a dot, which should be deemed invalid.
  
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Construct an email string such as ".username@example.com".
- **Act:** Execute the `IsValidEmail` function using this email.
- **Assert:** Expect `false` as the return value.

**Validation:**
- The result should be `false` since starting with a dot violates email formatting rules.
- Important for preventing invalid inputs that may lead to issues in user registrations or data processing.

### Scenario 4: Valid Email with Numbers and Dashes

**Details:**
- **Description:** Checks whether an email containing numbers and dashes, which are valid, returns `true`.
  
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Use an email format like "user123-name@example.com".
- **Act:** Execute the `IsValidEmail` function with this input.
- **Assert:** Confirm the result is `true`.

**Validation:**
- Should return `true` as numbers and dashes are valid in email addresses.
- Supports diverse input types, reflecting real-world valid email configurations.

### Scenario 5: Valid Email with Plus Sign

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test ensures that emails using a plus sign, typically for email aliases, are correctly validated as true.
  
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Construct an email such as "user+label@example.com".
- **Act:** Pass this email to the `IsValidEmail` function.
- **Assert:** Verify that the outcome is `true`.

**Validation:**
- Expected to be `true` since plus signs are commonly in email aliasing.
- Important for respecting users' privacy and preference in email organization.

### Scenario 6: Invalid Email with Space in Local Part

**Details:**
- **Description:** Tests function against an invalid email with a space in the local part, ensuring it returns `false`.
  
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Choose an email like "user name@example.com".
- **Act:** Call `IsValidEmail` with this email string.
- **Assert:** Result should be `false`.

**Validation:**
- `false` is expected because spaces in the local part are not allowed.
- Validating formatting prevents unsuccessful data capturing or communication failures.

### Scenario 7: Valid Email with Special Characters

**Details:**
- **Description:** Ensure the function accepts emails with valid special characters like underscores.
  
**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Utilize an email such as "user_name@example.com".
- **Act:** Apply the email to the `IsValidEmail` function.
- **Assert:** The function should return `true`.

**Validation:**
- Result should be `true` as underscores are allowed.
- Ensures broad compatibility with various user-generated email addresses.

These scenarios together cover additional edge cases and functionality beyond those already tested, supporting robust verification of email validity according to common standards.
