Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/IsValidEmail_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Based on the provided function and existing tests, here are additional test scenarios for the IsValidEmail function:

Scenario 1: Email with multiple dots in domain

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address with multiple dots in the domain part is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with multiple dots in the domain.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Check if the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles valid email addresses with multiple dots in the domain, which are allowed according to email standards.

Scenario 2: Email with plus sign in local part

Details:
  Description: Verify that an email address containing a plus sign in the local part is accepted as valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email address with a plus sign in the local part.
  Act: Pass the email address to IsValidEmail.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Plus signs are allowed in the local part of email addresses and are often used for email filtering. This test ensures the function recognizes such addresses as valid.

Scenario 3: Email with IP address as domain

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address using an IP address enclosed in square brackets as the domain is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with an IP address as the domain.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  While less common, email addresses with IP addresses as domains are valid. This test ensures the function correctly handles this format.

Scenario 4: Email with non-ASCII characters

Details:
  Description: Check if the function correctly handles email addresses containing non-ASCII characters (e.g., UTF-8).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email address with non-ASCII characters in the local part.
  Act: Pass the email address to IsValidEmail.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected result based on the implementation.
Validation:
  This test verifies how the function handles internationalized email addresses. The expected result depends on whether the implementation supports such addresses.

Scenario 5: Email with very short local part and domain

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior with an email address having minimal length in both local part and domain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with a single character local part and a short domain (e.g., "a@b.c").
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles valid email addresses that are extremely short but still meet the minimum requirements.

Scenario 6: Email with quoted local part

Details:
  Description: Verify if the function accepts an email address with a quoted local part containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email address with a quoted local part containing spaces and special characters.
  Act: Pass the email address to IsValidEmail.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected result based on the implementation.
Validation:
  Quoted local parts are allowed in email addresses and can contain otherwise invalid characters. This test checks if the function supports this advanced email format.

These additional scenarios cover more edge cases and specific email formats that weren't addressed in the existing tests, providing a more comprehensive test suite for the IsValidEmail function.
