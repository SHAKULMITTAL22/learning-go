File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/IsValidEmail_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Here are the generated test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function based on the provided details:

### Scenario 1: Valid Email with Subdomain

**Details:**
- **Description:** This test checks whether an email address with a subdomain is considered valid by the function. This includes emails like `user@mail.example.com`.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Prepare a valid email address with a subdomain.
- **Act:** Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this email.
- **Assert:** Check that the function returns `true`.

**Validation:**
- **Explain:** The assertion is designed to validate that subdomain handling is correct in the regex. This is important as many organizations use subdomains for email.
- **Importance:** Ensures that emails with subdomains are not mistakenly rejected, maintaining system compatibility with a wide range of valid email addresses.

### Scenario 2: Invalid Email with Double Dot

**Details:**
- **Description:** Test for an invalid email with consecutive dots, which should be considered invalid, e.g., `user@domain..com`.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Create an email string with consecutive dots.
- **Act:** Pass this string to `IsValidEmail`.
- **Assert:** Assert the return value is `false`.

**Validation:**
- **Explain:** Consecutive dots are often not allowed in email addresses by standards, so this test confirms the function adheres to that rule.
- **Importance:** Prevents acceptance of pathologically malformed email structures.

### Scenario 3: Email with Special Characters

**Details:**
- **Description:** Tests the function's ability to handle special characters in the email's local part. Valid examples include `user+mailbox@example.com`.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Use a valid email that contains special characters in the local part.
- **Act:** Pass it to the function.
- **Assert:** Verify the result is `true`.

**Validation:**
- **Explain:** The use of special characters in the local part of an email is valid according to RFC specifications, so the regex must correctly handle them.
- **Importance:** In places where emails are dynamically generated with special characters, this test ensures these emails aren't erroneously rejected.

### Scenario 4: Email with Trailing Dot

**Details:**
- **Description:** Test the scenario where an email has a trailing dot, which should be invalid, e.g., `user@example.com.`.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Define an email with a trailing dot.
- **Act:** Invoke `IsValidEmail` with the email.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `false`.

**Validation:**
- **Explain:** A trailing dot on the domain part can cause issues with email delivery and is disallowed.
- **Importance:** This validation ensures input sanitation prevents malformed emails that could crash consumers expecting valid emails.

### Scenario 5: Email with Quoted Local Part

**Details:**
- **Description:** Check if an email with a quoted local part is marked as valid, e.g., `"user"@example.com`.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Create an email string with a quoted local part.
- **Act:** Pass this email to the function.
- **Assert:** Assert that the function returns `true`.

**Validation:**
- **Explain:** Email standards allow for quoted strings in the local part, and maintaining this ensures the regex accommodates complete RFC compliance.
- **Importance:** It ensures legacy email formats that utilize this syntax remain operable.

These scenarios aim to verify the robustness of the `IsValidEmail` function, examining both common and edge cases, ensuring alignment with email formatting standards and anticipated usage.
