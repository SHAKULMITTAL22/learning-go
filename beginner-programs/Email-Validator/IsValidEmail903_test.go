Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/IsValidEmail_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Based on the provided function and existing tests, here are additional test scenarios for the IsValidEmail function:

Scenario 1: Email with multiple dots in domain

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address with multiple dots in the domain part is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with multiple dots in the domain.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles valid email addresses with multiple dots in the domain, which are allowed according to email standards.

Scenario 2: Email with special characters in local part

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address with allowed special characters in the local part is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with special characters like !#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~ in the local part.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles valid email addresses with special characters in the local part, as per email standards.

Scenario 3: Email with quoted local part

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address with a quoted local part containing special characters is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with a quoted local part containing spaces and special characters.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles valid email addresses with quoted local parts, which allow for a wider range of characters.

Scenario 4: Email with IP address as domain

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address using an IP address as the domain is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with an IP address as the domain.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly validates email addresses using IP addresses as domains, which are less common but valid.

Scenario 5: Email with subdomain

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address with a subdomain is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with a subdomain in the domain part.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles valid email addresses with subdomains, which are common in many organizations.

Scenario 6: Email with long local part

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address with a long local part (but still within limits) is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with a local part that's 64 characters long (the maximum allowed).
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles email addresses with the maximum allowed length for the local part, ensuring it doesn't incorrectly reject valid but long email addresses.

Scenario 7: Email with punycode domain

Details:
  Description: Test if an email address with a punycode-encoded internationalized domain name is considered valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with a punycode-encoded domain.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles email addresses with internationalized domain names encoded in punycode, which are becoming more common with the global internet.

These scenarios cover additional aspects of email validation that weren't addressed in the existing tests, including various edge cases and less common but valid email formats. They help ensure that the IsValidEmail function is robust and compliant with email standards.
