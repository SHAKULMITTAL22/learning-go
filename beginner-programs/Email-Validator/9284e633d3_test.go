    "vulnerability": "CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts",
    "issue": "The IsValidEmail function does not implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms, which could allow attackers to perform brute-force attacks or username enumeration.",

    "issue": "The regular expression used to validate emails may not cover all valid email address scenarios according to RFC 5322, potentially rejecting valid emails or accepting invalid ones.",
    "solution": "Revise the regular expression used for email validation to comply fully with RFC 5322 or use a well-maintained package dedicated to email validation."

Based on the content of the `email.go` file within the `Email-Validator` directory, we can see that the package name is `Validator`, and the function `IsValidEmail` checks the validity of an email using a regex pattern. The function also enforces a maximum length of 254 characters for the email address. Based on this, let's write some test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function.

---

Scenario 1: Valid Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithValidAddress
  Description: This test examines the IsValidEmail function to ensure it returns true for a standard, valid email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid email address string.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the prepared valid email address.
  Assert: Use Go's testing package to assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  Justify: A valid email address should pass the regex validation and the length check, resulting in a true return value.
  Importance: This test asserts the function's capability to correctly recognize a properly formatted email, which is critical for user input validation in applications.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Address with Incorrect Format

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithInvalidFormat
  Description: This test validates that IsValidEmail correctly identifies an incorrectly formatted email address and returns false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address string with an incorrect format (e.g., missing '@' symbol).
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the improperly formatted email address.
  Assert: Use Go's testing package to check that the outcome is false.
Validation:
  Justify: An incorrectly formatted email address should fail the regex validation, which should lead to a false return value.
  Importance: Identifying and rejecting incorrectly formatted emails is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing invalid user input.

Scenario 3: Invalid Email Address Exceeds Maximum Length

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithExcessiveLength
  Description: This scenario checks that IsValidEmail returns false for an email address exceeding the maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an email address string that is longer than 254 characters.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function using the excessively long email address.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the function is false using the Go testing framework.
Validation:
  Justify: An overly long email address will breach the length constraint before the regex pattern is checked, resulting in a false outcome.
  Importance: This test is vital to confirm that the application adheres to the email length standard, which may be enforced by email clients and servers.

Scenario 4: Empty Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithEmptyString
  Description: This test ensures that IsValidEmail returns false when provided with an empty email address string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty string as the email address.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the result is false using Go's testing assertions.
Validation:
  Justify: An empty string is not a valid email address and should not satisfy the regex pattern, leading to a false return value.
  Importance: Guaranteeing that empty strings are considered invalid prevents useless data being processed or stored.

These are a few scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function, covering both normal operation and edge/error cases. Additional scenarios might target more nuanced aspects of the email format, such as the presence of valid and invalid characters in different parts of the email or subdomain inclusions.
