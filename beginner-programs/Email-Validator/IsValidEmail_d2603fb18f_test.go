Test Scenarios for IsValidEmail function:

 1. Validate with an email address having a length less than 254 characters.
    Expected: The function should return true if the provided email is valid.

 2. Validate with an email address having a length exactly equal to 254 characters.
    Expected: The function should return true if the provided email is valid.

 3. Validate with an email address having a length more than 254 characters.
    Expected: The function should return false as the length exceeds the limit.

 4. Validate with an invalid email constructed randomly or without the '@' symbol.
    Expected: The function should return false as it's not a valid email.

 5. Validate with an empty string.
    Expected: The function should return false as it's not a valid email.

 6. Validate with non string input.
    Expected: The function should throw an error as the input is not a string.

 7. Validate with a valid email along with leading or trailing spaces.
    Expected: The function should return false as the email is not valid due to leading or trailing spaces.

 8. Validate with the email in different case than the original one.
    Expected: The function should return true because an email address is case-insensitive.

 9. Validate with a Unicode email address.
    Expected: The corresponding result based on the regex defined.

 10. Validate with a null input.
    Expected: It should throw an error, as the input is null, and null is not a valid string.

 11. Validate with special characters in the local part of email.
    Expected: The corresponding result based on the regex defined.

 12. Validate with the email where domain name having different top-level domains (like .com, .org, .net etc.).
    Expected: The function should return true if the provided email is valid.
