ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The email validation function does not sanitize input before processing, leading to potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
Solution: Implement comprehensive input sanitization before validating the email to ensure only valid characters are processed.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: The code does not implement rate limiting or account locking mechanisms, which could allow attackers to perform brute force attacks on email validation.
Solution: Introduce a rate limiting mechanism or account locking features to mitigate brute force attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: Without a limit on the size of the email input, the application could be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks through resource exhaustion.
Solution: Enforce strict length checks on the email input to prevent excessively large inputs from being processed.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The code snippet does not show the implementation of 'emailRegexp', leaving uncertainty about the security of the regex pattern used for email validation.
Solution: Ensure the regex pattern used for email validation is secure and does not introduce vulnerabilities such as ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).

================================================================================
### Scenario 1: Valid Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithValidAddress
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a valid email address.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable containing a valid email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the prepared email address.
  Assert: Use Go's `testing` package to assert that the function returns `true`.

Validation:
  The assertion for `true` is based on the RFC standards for a valid email format that the regular expression is expected to check against. This test ensures the function fulfills its primary purpose for typical use cases.

### Scenario 2: Email Address Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithLongAddress
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies an email address exceeding the maximum length as invalid.

Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a string variable containing an email address longer than 254 characters.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns `false`.

Validation:
  The assertion for `false` is based on the function's explicit check for the email length. This scenario tests the function's ability to enforce maximum length constraints, which is vital for database storage considerations and avoiding buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

### Scenario 3: Empty Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithEmptyString
  Description: Checks if the function identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.

Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty string variable to represent the email address.
  Act: Execute the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns `false`.

Validation:
  The assertion for `false` reflects the expectation that a valid email cannot be an empty string. This test is important for validating input data, especially in user registration flows or anywhere email addresses are required inputs.

### Scenario 4: Email Address Without At-Symbol

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithoutAtSymbol
  Description: Verifies that the function identifies an email address missing the "@" symbol as invalid.

Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable with an email address format but without the "@" symbol.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with this string.
  Assert: Assert the function returns `false`.

Validation:
  The assertion for `false` is crucial since the presence of "@" is a fundamental part of email address formatting. This scenario checks the function's adherence to basic email validation rules.

### Scenario 5: Email Address With Special Characters

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Tests whether the function can correctly handle email addresses containing special characters.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable with an email address that includes allowed special characters.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the special character-containing email.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns `true`.

Validation:
  This assertion for `true` verifies the function's compliance with the RFC specification allowing certain special characters within email addresses. It's important for ensuring the function doesn't falsely reject valid emails with special characters.

### Scenario 6: Email Address With Multiple At-Symbols

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithMultipleAtSymbols
  Description: Checks if the function identifies an email address with more than one "@" symbol as invalid.

Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string variable containing an email address with more than one "@" symbol.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with this email address.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns `false`.

Validation:
  The assertion for `false` is based on the standard email format, which allows for only one "@" symbol. This test ensures the function can correctly identify format violations, preventing potential parsing errors or security vulnerabilities.
