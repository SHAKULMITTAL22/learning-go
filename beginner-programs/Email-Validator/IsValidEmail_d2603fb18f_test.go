ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The email validation function does not properly validate the email format. An attacker could provide a string that is not a valid email but passes the length check, potentially leading to further processing of invalid data.
Solution: Use a proper email validation library or regular expression to validate the email format. For instance, use the 'net/mail' package's ParseAddress function in Golang.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The use of MatchString from 'regexp' package could lead to ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) if an attacker provides a specially crafted string.
Solution: It's recommended to use time-bounded regular expression matching provided by third-party libraries such as 'regexp2', or limit the complexity of the regular expression to prevent potential ReDoS attacks.

Vulnerability: Uninitialized Variable
Issue: The variable 'emailRegexp' is not initialized in this code snippet, which would lead to a runtime panic if this function is called.
Solution: Initialize 'emailRegexp' with a proper regular expression for email validation. Make sure the regular expression is safe and cannot be exploited for ReDoS attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Email Test

Details:
    TestName: TestValidEmail
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly validates a properly formatted email.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid email string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email string.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a valid email. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given valid data.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test

Details:
    TestName: TestInvalidEmail
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an improperly formatted email.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an invalid email string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email string.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an invalid email. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given invalid data.

Scenario 3: Empty String Test

Details:
    TestName: TestEmptyStringEmail
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given an empty string.

Scenario 4: Long Email Test

Details:
    TestName: TestLongEmail
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an email string that is too long as invalid.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid email string that is longer than 254 characters.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email string.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a too-long email string as invalid. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given an excessively long string.

Scenario 5: Edge Case - Maximum Length Email Test

Details:
    TestName: TestMaxLenEmail
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an email string that is exactly 254 characters long as valid.
Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid email string that is exactly 254 characters long.
    Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the max length email string.
    Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a max-length email string as valid. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves as expected when given an email string of maximum length.
