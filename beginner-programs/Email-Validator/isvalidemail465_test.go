Existing Test Information:

File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/IsValidEmail_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Here are the test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function from the `Validator` package using Go testing practices. Given that some test cases are already provided, we will generate new scenarios ensuring a comprehensive examination of the function, covering additional edge cases and normal operations.

### Scenario 1: Email with Leading Dot in Local Part

Details:
  Description: This test checks if an email with a leading dot in the local part is considered invalid, which aligns with standard email validation rules.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare an email address in the form of ".test@example.com".
  - Act: Pass this email to the `IsValidEmail` function.
  - Assert: Verify the function returns `false`.

Validation:
  - The assertion checks for `false` since a leading dot in the local part of an email address is not permitted by email standards.
  - This test ensures the email validation adheres to standard format rules, maintaining the integrity of inputs.

### Scenario 2: Email Ends with a Trailing Dot in Domain

Details:
  Description: Verify that an email ending with a trailing dot in the domain is deemed invalid.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an email formatted like "test@example.com.".
  - Act: Pass this email to the `IsValidEmail` function.
  - Assert: Confirm the function returns `false`.

Validation:
  - The expected result is `false` because domains cannot end with a trailing dot.
  - Ensures robust validation by restricting malformed domain names.

### Scenario 3: Email with Double Dot in Domain

Details:
  Description: Check if an email containing double periods within the domain is invalidated.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Use "test@exa..mple.com" as the test email.
  - Act: Provide this email to `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Ensure the result is `false`.

Validation:
  - The assertion expects `false`, obeying email standards which disallow sequential dots.
  - Important for rejecting non-standard email formats, enhancing user input validation.

### Scenario 4: Email with Underscore in Domain

Details:
  Description: Determine if an email with an underscore in the domain part is correctly flagged as invalid.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Set up "test@exa_mple.com".
  - Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this email.
  - Assert: Validate the result is `false`.

Validation:
  - Expected `false` as underscores are not allowed in domain names under standard internet hostname rules.
  - Prevents invalid domain structures and enhances adherence to common practices.

### Scenario 5: Email with Quoted Local Part

Details:
  Description: Evaluate if an email with a quoted local part is accepted as valid.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Input `"test"@example.com`.
  - Act: Use `IsValidEmail` to evaluate the email.
  - Assert: Check for `true`.

Validation:
  - Expects `true`, acknowledging that quoted local parts are valid per RFC standards.
  - Critical for accepting valid yet commonly misunderstood email formats.

### Scenario 6: Internationalized Domain Name

Details:
  Description: Validate if the function correctly processes emails using internationalized domain names (IDNs).

Execution:
  - Arrange: Utilize "user@xn--example-9ja.com", which is a Punycode representation for internationalized domains.
  - Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Verify it returns `true`.

Validation:
  - The correct handling of `true` signifies support for IDNs, expanding usability for non-ASCII domain names.
  - Emphasizes the application's global capability and adherence to modern email standards.

### Scenario 7: Numeric Domain

Details:
  Description: Assess whether an email with a purely numeric domain is regarded as valid.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Use "test@123.com".
  - Act: Pass it to `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Expect `true`.

Validation:
  - The logic requires `true` as numeric domains are legal.
  - Validating such inputs caters to correctly processing all valid domain forms.

### Scenario 8: Excessive Number of Subdomains

Details:
  Description: Test the email validation against an excessive number of subdomains to assert the structural limits.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Construct an email like "test@sub1.sub2.sub3.sub4.sub5.sub6.sub7.sub8.sub9.sub10.example.com".
  - Act: Evaluate with `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Expect `true` or appropriate handling based on domain rules.

Validation:
  - Assesses whether email component limits affect validation; the result depends on the specific structural logic enforcement.
  - Ensures function robustness, considering valid yet extreme domain structures.

### Scenario 9: Long Local Part within Limits

Details:
  Description: Examine how the function deals with emails having a long local part that doesn't exceed overall length constraints.

Execution:
  - Arrange: Construct an email like "longlocalpartname@short.com" within the 64-character limit for the local part.
  - Act: Insert this into `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Check for `true`.

Validation:
  - Expected `true` to reflect legal local part length, within the allowable boundary.
  - Validates correct handling of email fields that are at their maximum sizes without exceeding total limits.

These scenarios have been devised to provide thorough coverage for various cases â€” normal operation, edge cases, and error handling, thereby ensuring `IsValidEmail` performs effectively across different input variations and adheres to established protocols.
