ROOST_METHOD_HASH=IsValidEmail_9ebd397bff
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function IsValidEmail does not check if the email is empty or null, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add a check at the beginning of the function to return false if the email is empty or null.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash Without a Salt
Issue: The emailRegexp variable is compiled once and reused for all calls to IsValidEmail. If an attacker can control the input to this function, they can potentially cause a denial-of-service attack by providing a specially crafted email address.
Solution: Compile the regular expression inside the IsValidEmail function, or use a different method to validate email addresses that does not rely on regular expressions.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Valid Email

   Details:
     Description: Check if a valid email address is identified as valid by the function.

   Execution:
     Arrange: Provide a valid email address, such as "test@example.com".
     Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the provided email address.
     Assert: Assert that the function returns true.

   Validation:
     The assertion checks whether the function correctly identifies a valid email address. This test is crucial to confirm that the function works as intended for regular use cases.

2. Scenario: Empty String

   Details:
     Description: Test if the function handles an empty string as input.

   Execution:
     Arrange: Set up an empty string.
     Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
     Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

   Validation:
     The assertion confirms that the function handles an empty string gracefully and returns false, as expected.

3. Scenario: Long Email

   Details:
     Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies an email address that is too long.

   Execution:
     Arrange: Prepare an email address that is longer than 255 characters.
     Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the prepared email address.
     Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

   Validation:
     The assertion ensures the function correctly identifies and rejects email addresses that exceed the maximum allowed length.

4. Scenario: Email with Special Characters

   Details:
     Description: Test an email address containing special characters in the local part.

   Execution:
     Arrange: Prepare an email address with special characters, such as "test!#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~@example.com".
     Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the prepared email address.
     Assert: Assert that the function returns true.

   Validation:
     The assertion verifies that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses with special characters in the local part, as specified in the RFC 5322 standard.

5. Scenario: Email without TLD

   Details:
     Description: Verify the function's behavior when an email address has no top-level domain (TLD).

   Execution:
     Arrange: Prepare an email address without a TLD, such as "test@example".
     Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the prepared email address.
     Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

   Validation:
     The assertion ensures the function correctly identifies and rejects email addresses without a TLD, which is part of the email address structure.

6. Scenario: Email with Multiple '@' Symbols

   Details:
     Description: Test an email address with multiple '@' symbols.

   Execution:
     Arrange: Prepare an email address with multiple '@' symbols, such as "test@example.com@example.com".
     Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the prepared email address.
     Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

   Validation:
     The assertion confirms that the function correctly identifies and rejects email addresses with multiple '@' symbols, as they are not valid according to the email address standard.

7. Scenario: Email with No '@' Symbol

   Details:
     Description: Test an email address without an '@' symbol.

   Execution:
     Arrange: Prepare an email address without an '@' symbol, such as "testexample.com".
     Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the prepared email address.
     Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

   Validation:
     The assertion ensures the function correctly identifies and rejects email addresses without an '@' symbol, as they are not valid according to the email address standard.

8. Scenario: Email with Whitespace

   Details:
     Description: Test an email address with leading or trailing whitespace.

   Execution:
     Arrange: Prepare an email address with leading or trailing whitespace, such as " test@example.com ".
     Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the prepared email address.
     Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

   Validation:
     The assertion confirms that the function correctly identifies and rejects email addresses with leading or trailing whitespace, as they are not valid according to the email address standard.

// Note: The error "emailRegexp redeclared in this block" indicates that the emailRegexp variable is declared in both the test file and the main file. In the given test file, I have removed the unnecessary import statements and kept only the required ones. Also, I have removed the duplicate declaration of emailRegexp variable.

// However, the error "undefined: utf8" indicates that there is a missing import for the "unicode/utf8" package in the main file. Please add the following import statement in the main file to resolve this issue:
// "unicode/utf8"

// Also, there is a redeclaration of the TestIsValidEmail function in the test file. I have renamed the test function to TestIsValidEmail419 to avoid this error.

// Lastly, please ensure that the IsValidEmail function handles the case where the email address is longer than 255 characters, as the test case "Long Email" checks for this scenario. You can modify the IsValidEmail function to return false if the email length is greater than 255.
