Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Below are several test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function based on the information provided. These scenarios are designed to cover both typical and edge cases to ensure comprehensive validation of email strings.

### Scenario 1: Valid Email Format with Subdomain

**Details:**  
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an email with a subdomain as valid. Subdomains are commonly used and should be handled correctly.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Prepare an email string in the format "user@mail.example.com".
- **Act:** Call `IsValidEmail` with this email string.
- **Assert:** Verify that the function returns `true`.

**Validation:**  
This test uses a valid email format with a subdomain, expecting `true`. Subdomains are a standard part of many email addresses, and validating them ensures the function's robustness in real-world scenarios.

---

### Scenario 2: Email With Special Characters

**Details:**  
Description: Test if the function accepts emails with special characters in the local part, which are valid according to RFC standards.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Use an email like "user.name+tag@domain.com".
- **Act:** Invoke `IsValidEmail` with the test email.
- **Assert:** Confirm the result is `true`.

**Validation:**  
Special characters are permissible within email local parts. This scenario ensures the function does not falsely reject such valid configurations.

---

### Scenario 3: Invalid Email with Incorrect Placement of "."

**Details:**  
Description: Examine how the function handles an email with a "." placed at the beginning of the local part, which is not allowed.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Construct the email ".user@domain.com".
- **Act:** Call `IsValidEmail` with this input.
- **Assert:** Expect the return value to be `false`.

**Validation:**  
Leading periods in the local part should invalidate an email, maintaining compliance with email format standards. This test ensures these rules are enforced.

---

### Scenario 4: Valid Email with Numeric Domain

**Details:**  
Description: Evaluate if the function correctly validates emails with numeric domains, which are technically valid.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Use a format like "user@123.com".
- **Act:** Execute `IsValidEmail` using this email.
- **Assert:** Check that the result is `true`.

**Validation:**  
Numeric domains exist and are valid, so the function should apply the standard pattern to confirm their correctness, not relying only on alphabetical domain names.

---

### Scenario 5: Email with Invalid TLD

**Details:**  
Description: Verify the function's capability to reject emails with non-existent top-level domains (TLDs).

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Prepare an email, e.g., "user@domain.1234".
- **Act:** Pass this to `IsValidEmail`.
- **Assert:** The output should be `false`.

**Validation:**  
TLD validation is crucial for email legitimacy. Incorrect TLDs can lead to failures in delivering communications. This test protects against such errors.

---

### Scenario 6: Email with Multiple Consecutive Dots

**Details:**  
Description: Test if multiple consecutive dots in the local part of an email result in rejection, as these should be invalid.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Create the email "user..name@domain.com".
- **Act:** Use `IsValidEmail` with this input.
- **Assert:** Ensure the return is `false`.

**Validation:**  
Consecutive dots are not permitted in emails under most standards. This scenario upholds email structure integrity, reflecting common validation requirements.

---

### Scenario 7: Uppercase Domain Name

**Details:**  
Description: Ascertain whether the function successfully validates an email with an uppercase domain, reflecting case insensitivity.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Use "user@DOMAIN.COM".
- **Act:** Run `IsValidEmail` on this email.
- **Assert:** The function should return `true`.

**Validation:**  
Domains are case-insensitive but often present in mixed cases, so accurate validation without false negatives supports realistic email patterns.

---

These scenarios aim to challenge the `IsValidEmail` function across varied inputs, ensuring both compliance with standards and resilience against unconventional yet valid patterns.
