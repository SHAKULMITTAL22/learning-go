================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure-regular-expression
Issue: The email validation regular expression may allow a denial-of-service attack (ReDoS) if an attacker can provide input that takes excessive time to validate.
Solution: Consider using a time-out feature for regex matching or a third-party library that guarantees safe email validation with linear-time complexity.

Vulnerability: lack-of-email-normalization
Issue: The provided email validation fails to normalize emails before validation, potentially leading to inconsistent validation outcomes.
Solution: Normalize the email address before validation. This includes lowercasing the local part and domain of the email and removing dots from the local part for certain domain providers.

Vulnerability: incomplete-validation-logic
Issue: The regex for email validation does not check for the presence of the top-level domain (TLD), resulting in potential acceptance of invalid email formats.
Solution: Extend the regex to include a final section that enforces the presence of a top-level domain (TLD).

================================================================================
Based on the code snippet and the function `IsValidEmail`, let's develop meaningful test scenarios to ensure the validity of the email addresses being checked. 

---

### Scenario 1: Valid Email Addresses

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithValidAddresses
  Description: This test examines the `IsValidEmail` function with common variations of valid email addresses to ensure that the function correctly identifies valid email formats.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of valid email strings that conform to typical email address structures.
  Act: Iterate through the list of valid email addresses and invoke `IsValidEmail` for each one.
  Assert: Use `testing.T`'s `t.Errorf()` method to flag any valid email address that `IsValidEmail` incorrectly identifies as invalid.
Validation:
  Justify: Since the function uses regular expressions to validate emails, these test cases will ensure that common patterns which are expected to be valid do not fail the validation.
  Importance: The ability to correctly identify valid email addresses is crucial to allow users to register, receive notifications, or reset passwords, which are typical use cases in applications.

---

### Scenario 2: Invalid Email Addresses

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithInvalidAddresses
  Description: This test checks the `IsValidEmail` function with various invalid email addresses to confirm that the function correctly rejects emails with incorrect formats.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of invalid email strings that represent different invalid patterns, including missing '@' symbol, special characters in improper places, and invalid domain parts.
  Act: Iterate through the list of invalid email addresses and call `IsValidEmail` for each.
  Assert: Assert that each invalid email address returns false using `testing.T`'s `t.Errorf()` if any invalid email is marked as valid.
Validation:
  Justify: Testing invalid patterns ensure our application doesn't accept malformed email addresses, which could lead to undeliverable emails or potential security vulnerabilities.
  Importance: Preventing invalid email formats is as significant as allowing valid ones; it helps maintain data integrity and application security.

---

### Scenario 3: Maximum Length Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithMaxLength
  Description: This test evaluates the `IsValidEmail` function with an email address that is exactly at the maximum length limit (255 characters) to ensure proper boundary handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an email address string that is exactly 255 characters long, including the local and domain parts.
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with the constructed email address as the parameter.
  Assert: Check if the function returns true for this maximum length valid email address using `testing.T`'s `t.Errorf()` if it returns false.
Validation:
  Justify: The test checks the proper handling of the email length boundary condition as specified in the function's initial length check.
  Importance: It's important to test boundary conditions to avoid off-by-one errors and ensure that the application is adhering to the correct length specifications for email.

---

### Scenario 4: Exceeding Maximum Length Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithLengthExceeds
  Description: This test ensures that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly handles email addresses exceeding the maximum length limit of 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email address string that exceeds 255 characters.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the lengthy email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false for these email addresses using `testing.T`'s `t.Errorf()` if it otherwise returns true.
Validation:
  Justify: The test ensures that the function enforces the email length constraint as having excessively long email addresses may not be supported by email services and could affect application performance.
  Importance: The ability to reject email addresses that are too long protects the application and email services from potential issues related to processing such data.

---

Additional scenarios can be derived from different special characters allowed within email addresses, different domain suffixes, and email addresses that contain IP addresses instead of domain names. However, the provided scenarios above should offer a comprehensive coverage of core functionality and edge cases for the `IsValidEmail` function.
