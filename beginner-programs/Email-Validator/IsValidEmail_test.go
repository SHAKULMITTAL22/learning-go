Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Below are various test scenarios designed for the `IsValidEmail` function in the context of normal operation, edge cases, and error handling. These scenarios are crafted to provide comprehensive coverage of the function's intended behavior.

### Scenario 1: Valid Email with Maximum Allowed Length

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies valid emails with a length equal to the maximum allowed (255 characters).
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Construct a valid email address that is exactly 255 characters long.
  - Act: Pass this email address to the `IsValidEmail` function.
  - Assert: Confirm that the function returns `true`.

Validation:
  The test asserts that a valid email at the boundary of allowed length is identified correctly as valid. This is important for ensuring the application's capability to handle long but valid email addresses without unnecessary rejection.

### Scenario 2: Email Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This test examines if the function rightly rejects email addresses exceeding the length limit of 255 characters.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an email that is 256 characters long.
  - Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this email.
  - Assert: Check that the function returns `false`.

Validation:
  This test checks the upper boundary condition, ensuring emails violating the length constraint are not accepted. Compliance with specifications involving input size limits is essential for buffer management and avoiding potential vulnerabilities or errors.

### Scenario 3: Email Matching the Basic Pattern

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to identify a simple, valid email pattern (e.g., "user@example.com").
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Define a typical valid email address.
  - Act: Evaluate it with the `IsValidEmail` function.
  - Assert: Ensure the result is `true`.

Validation:
  The use of a common, valid email format to validate the regex pattern ensures basic functionality aligns with general email standards, a fundamental requirement for any email validation functionality.

### Scenario 4: Missing "@" Character

Details:
  Description: Verifies that an email missing the "@" character is deemed invalid.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Construct an email string without the "@" character (e.g., "userexample.com").
  - Act: Test this with `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Confirm it returns `false`.

Validation:
  Validating based on the absence of vital email components is key to filtering out malformed inputs that could lead to erroneous processing or miscommunication.

### Scenario 5: Missing Domain in Email

Details:
  Description: Ensures that emails lacking a domain part (e.g., "user@") are invalid.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Provide an email structure missing the domain section.
  - Act: Pass this to the `IsValidEmail` function.
  - Assert: Confirm the output is `false`.

Validation:
  This test verifies the necessity of a complete domain part after "@", a critical validation for any input representing a comprehensive email address.

### Scenario 6: Email with Special Characters in Local Part

Details:
  Description: Test whether the function correctly validates emails where special characters are allowed (e.g., "user.name+tag@example.com").
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Generate an email containing valid special characters.
  - Act: Pass the structured email to `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Check for a `true` return value.

Validation:
  Confirming special characters in the local part are processed as valid ensures diverse email formats are accepted, broadening usability and conformity to broader email standards.

### Scenario 7: Email with Consecutive Dots in Local Part

Details:
  Description: Ensures emails with consecutive dots in the local segment are declined as invalid.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Design an email address with multiple consecutive dots (e.g., "user..example@example.com").
  - Act: Use this with the `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Verify it returns `false`.

Validation:
  The scenario emphasizes rejecting syntactically incorrect emails, crucial for maintaining standard-compliant inputs and avoiding errors in email delivery systems.

### Scenario 8: Unsupported Characters in Email

Details:
  Description: Tests function response to emails containing unsupported characters, like spaces.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an email with spaces or invalid symbols (e.g., "user name@example.com").
  - Act: Pass it through `IsValidEmail`.
  - Assert: Ensure the outcome is `false`.

Validation:
  Filtering out unsupported characters is vital to enforce format conformity and prevent malicious input that exploits lax validation routines.

These scenarios are carefully crafted to ensure that both common/valid email formats and incorrect/malformed addresses are thoroughly tested, aligning with business rules and technical constraints of the email validation function within an application context.

// Error Analysis and Improvements:
// - Fixed the email regular expression pattern by adding the closing bracket to prevent syntax errors.
// - Ensure package naming consistency to avoid package conflicts, ensuring 'validator' is used in both test and main files.
//
// Recommendation: 
// - Introduce additional edge cases, such as emails with unsupported TLDs or exceeding subdomain depth.
// - Consider using mocks/stubs if email validation involves external API calls in the future.
// - Enhance error messages to include more test scenario details for ease of debugging.
// - Use sub-tests in table-driven tests for better structure when dealing with complex test cases.
//
// Potential Enhancements:
// - Consider concurrency testing if the validation function is expected to handle high throughput environments. 
// - Enhance input sanitization checks to reject invalid input types or formats earlier in the process.
