Scenario 1: Validating a correct email address with a domain name and TLD

Details:
Description: This test scenario aims to ensure that the IsValidEmail function correctly validates a well-formed email address with a domain name and TLD, adhering to the common email address format.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up a valid email address string, e.g., "john.doe@example.com".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns true, as the email address is valid.
Validation:
This test scenario is essential for confirming that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies valid email addresses, ensuring that users can register or log in with their correct email addresses.

Scenario 2: Validating an email address with a single-character local part

Details:
Description: This test scenario is designed to check whether the IsValidEmail function correctly validates an email address with a single-character local part.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up a valid email address with a single-character local part, e.g., "a@example.com".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns true, as the email address is valid.
Validation:
This test scenario is important for verifying that the IsValidEmail function can handle single-character local parts, ensuring that the function is robust and compliant with the email address format.

---

Scenario 3: Validating an email address with a long domain name

Details:
Description: This test scenario aims to ensure that the IsValidEmail function correctly validates an email address with a long domain name.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up a valid email address with a long domain name, e.g., "john.doe@thisisalongdomainnamethatislongerthan255characters.com".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns false, as the domain name exceeds the maximum allowed length of 255 characters.
Validation:
This test scenario is crucial for verifying that the IsValidEmail function can handle long domain names and complies with the email address format's length limitations.

---

Scenario 4: Validating an email address with an empty local part

Details:
Description: This test scenario is designed to check whether the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address with an empty local part.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up an invalid email address with an empty local part, e.g., "@example.com".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns false, as the email address is invalid.
Validation:
This test scenario is important for ensuring that the IsValidEmail function can correctly identify invalid email addresses with empty local parts, preventing users from registering or logging in with such invalid addresses.

---

Scenario 5: Validating an email address with no TLD

Details:
Description: This test scenario aims to ensure that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address without a TLD.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up an invalid email address without a TLD, e.g., "john.doe@example".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns false, as the email address is invalid.
Validation:
This test scenario is crucial for verifying that the IsValidEmail function can correctly identify invalid email addresses without a TLD, ensuring that users cannot register or log in with such invalid addresses.

---

Scenario 6: Validating an email address with invalid characters in the local part

Details:
Description: This test scenario aims to verify that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address with invalid characters in the local part.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up an invalid email address with invalid characters in the local part, e.g., "john.doe!!@example.com".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns false, as the email address is invalid.
Validation:
This test scenario is essential for ensuring that the IsValidEmail function can correctly identify invalid email addresses with invalid characters in the local part, preventing users from registering or logging in with such invalid addresses.

---

Scenario 7: Validating an email address with a space in the local part

Details:
Description: This test scenario aims to verify that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a space in the local part.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up an invalid email address with a space in the local part, e.g., "john.doe @example.com".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns false, as the email address is invalid.
Validation:
This test scenario is essential for ensuring that the IsValidEmail function can correctly identify invalid email addresses with spaces in the local part, preventing users from registering or logging in with such invalid addresses.

---

Scenario 8: Validating an email address with a space in the domain part

Details:
Description: This test scenario aims to verify that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a space in the domain part.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up an invalid email address with a space in the domain part, e.g., "john.doe@example.com".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns false, as the email address is invalid.
Validation:
This test scenario is essential for ensuring that the IsValidEmail function can correctly identify invalid email addresses with spaces in the domain part, preventing users from registering or logging in with such invalid addresses.

---

Scenario 9: Validating an email address with a leading period in the local part

Details:
Description: This test scenario aims to verify that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a leading period in the local part.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up an invalid email address with a leading period in the local part, e.g., ".john.doe@example.com".
Act:
Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert:
Verify that the function returns false, as the email address is invalid.
Validation:
This test scenario is essential for ensuring that the IsValidEmail function can correctly identify invalid email addresses with leading periods in the local part, preventing users from registering or logging in with such invalid addresses.

---

Scenario 10: Validating an email address with a trailing period in the local part

Details:
Description: This test scenario aims to verify that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a trailing period in the local part.
Execution:
Arrange:
Set up an invalid email address with a trailing period in the local part, e.g., "john.doe.@example.com".
