    TestIsValidEmail
  ]### Scenario 1: Valid Email Format
Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies a properly formatted email address as valid. This includes checking typical email formats like `name@domain.com`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string with a valid email format.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the arranged string.
  Assert: Check if the function returns `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function recognizes standard email formats, which is essential for user validation in applications requiring email-based authentication or communication. Ensuring the function correctly identifies valid emails is crucial for reducing user input errors and ensuring valid data handling.

### Scenario 2: Email Exceeding Maximum Length
Details:
  Description: Test to ensure that `IsValidEmail` returns `false` for an email string exceeding the specified maximum length (255 characters). This test checks the function's ability to enforce length constraints.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string that is 256 characters long, structured as an email.
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with this long email string.
  Assert: Verify that the result is `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the function properly enforces length restrictions, which are important to prevent database or UI overflow errors and ensure consistent data storage practices.

### Scenario 3: Invalid Email Format - Missing At-Symbol
Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the `IsValidEmail` function can identify an email address that is missing the '@' symbol as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string that resembles an email but without the '@' symbol.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this incorrect format.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because the '@' symbol is a fundamental part of email addresses, and its absence typically indicates a fundamental typo or misunderstanding by the user. Validating this helps avoid processing incorrect contact information.

### Scenario 4: Invalid Email Format - Multiple At-Symbols
Details:
  Description: Evaluate whether `IsValidEmail` identifies email addresses with more than one '@' symbol as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that includes more than one '@' symbol.
  Act: Execute `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: Check for a `false` return value.
Validation:
  Multiple '@' symbols are not valid in email standards. Testing for this ensures the application can handle and reject these common input errors, maintaining the integrity of data collected.

### Scenario 5: Edge Case - Empty String
Details:
  Description: This scenario tests how `IsValidEmail` handles an empty string, which is a common edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty string as the input.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Validating that empty strings are considered invalid helps prevent user errors from proceeding through systems unchecked, potentially leading to errors in application processes that expect valid email addresses.

### Scenario 6: Valid Email with Plus Sign and Subdomain
Details:
  Description: Check if `IsValidEmail` correctly validates email addresses that include a '+' sign in the local part and subdomains in the domain part, such as `name+tag@sub.domain.com`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid email string with a '+' sign and subdomain.
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with this email.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `true`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to recognize complex but valid email addresses, ensuring broader user support and flexibility in email address variations, which are commonly used for filtering and organization in personal email management.
