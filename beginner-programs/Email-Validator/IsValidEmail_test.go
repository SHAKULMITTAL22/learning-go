================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not properly validate the input email string, allowing an attacker to potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by sending an email string longer than 255 bytes.
Solution: Implement a more robust input validation mechanism, such as checking for valid characters and using a library like 'github.com/netlify/netlify-commons/validation' to validate the email format.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The regular expression used for email validation is not RFC 5322 compliant, allowing invalid email addresses to pass validation.
Solution: Replace the regular expression with a more comprehensive one or use a library like 'github.com/netlify/netlify-commons/validation' to validate the email format.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid email address should return true

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly validates a valid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable with a valid email address, such as "test@example.com".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address as an argument.
    Assert: Check that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      We expect the IsValidEmail function to return true when given a valid email address, as defined by the emailRegexp variable.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      Validating email addresses is a common requirement in many applications. Ensuring that the IsValidEmail function correctly validates valid email addresses is crucial for user registration, password reset, and other email-related features.

Scenario 2: Invalid email address should return false

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly invalidates an invalid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an invalid email address, such as "test#example.com".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address as an argument.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      We expect the IsValidEmail function to return false when given an invalid email address, as defined by the emailRegexp variable.

      Validating email addresses is a common requirement in many applications. Ensuring that the IsValidEmail function correctly invalidates invalid email addresses is crucial for user registration, password reset, and other email-related features.

Scenario 3: Email address longer than 255 characters should return false

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly invalidates an email address longer than 255 characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an email address longer than 255 characters.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the long email address as an argument.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      We expect the IsValidEmail function to return false when given an email address longer than 255 characters, as defined by the function's implementation.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      Ensuring that the IsValidEmail function correctly handles edge cases, such as long email addresses, is essential for maintaining application stability and preventing unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Empty string should return false

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly invalidates an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable with an empty string.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the empty string as an argument.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      We expect the IsValidEmail function to return false when given an empty string, as it does not match the criteria for a valid email address.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      Handling edge cases, such as empty strings, is essential for ensuring that the application behaves predictably and handles user input gracefully.

Scenario 5: Null string should return false

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly invalidates a null string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string variable with a null value.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the null string as an argument.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result:
      We expect the IsValidEmail function to return false when given a null string, as it does not match the criteria for a valid email address.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements:
      Handling edge cases, such as null strings, is essential for ensuring that the application behaves predictably and handles user input gracefully.
