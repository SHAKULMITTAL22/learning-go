Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

```
Scenario 1: Validate Email Length Exceeds Maximum Limit

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies and rejects email addresses that exceed the allowable maximum length of 255 characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Construct an email address string with more than 255 characters.
    Act: Pass this long email string to the `IsValidEmail` function.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns false, indicating the email is invalid.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. The assertion confirms the function’s capacity to enforce length constraints, essential for maintaining database efficiency and ensuring compliance with email standards.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. This ensures that the application handles emails within a compatible size range, preventing potential performance issues or data storage anomalies.

Scenario 2: Validate Email Format Using Regular Expression

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the correct use of the regular expression in determining if a well-formed email matches expected patterns.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an email address formatted appropriately with common components (e.g., local part, domain, and top-level domain).
    Act: Pass the correctly formatted email to the `IsValidEmail` function.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns true, indicating the email format is acceptable.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Using true as the expected result demonstrates that the function can correctly identify well-formatted emails.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Accurate email validation ensures reliable communication and adherence to user input standards.

Scenario 3: Validate Empty Email String

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the `IsValidEmail` function handles and responds to an empty email string input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string as the email input.
    Act: Feed the empty email string into the `IsValidEmail` function.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns false, recognizing that an empty email is invalid.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Empty strings should logically be rejected, as they do not fulfill basic email structure requirements.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Validating this input guards against system errors and ensures only meaningful data is processed.

Scenario 4: Validate Email Without Local Part

Details:
  Description: This test assesses the function’s ability to detect and reject emails that lack the local part, a required section of an email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Input a string with the '@domain.com' format, which lacks the local part.
    Act: Execute the `IsValidEmail` function with this email.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Such strings are invalid, aligning with established email standards.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Ensuring integrity in user data entry minimizes delivery failures in communications.

Scenario 5: Validate Email Without Domain Part

Details:
  Description: This test examines if the `IsValidEmail` function can identify and refuse emails lacking a domain part.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an email formatted as 'localpart@', missing the domain.
    Act: Pass this malformed email to the function.
    Assert: Check for a false return from the function.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. The domain is crucial for routing emails; thus, its absence renders an email invalid.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. It is vital for applications that depend on exact email formats to maintain contact list integrity.

Scenario 6: Validate Email with Special Characters in Local Part

Details:
  Description: This test determines whether the function can process and validate emails with extended character sets, such as special symbols within the local part.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a test with an email formatted like 'user+name@domain.com'.
    Act: Use the `IsValidEmail` function for verification.
    Assert: Ensure the function returns true.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Properly handling special characters demonstrates robustness in accommodating modern, flexible email address usages.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Catering to diverse user requirements can enhance application usability and accessibility.

Scenario 7: Validate Partially Valid Email

Details:
  Description: This scenario looks at emails that are generally well-formed but fail due to minor structural errors (e.g., multiple @ symbols).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an improperly formatted email, e.g., 'user@@domain.com'.
    Act: Validate using the `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: Function should return false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. This protects against poorly formatted data that could otherwise integrate into the system.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. A proper validation system keeps databases clean and operation costs low.
