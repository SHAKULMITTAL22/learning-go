Existing Test Information:

File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/email_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Here are some test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function:

---

Scenario 1: Email Length Exceeds Maximum Limit

Details:
  Description: Verify that an email string longer than 255 characters is deemed invalid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an email string with more than 255 characters.
    Act: Pass the email string to the `IsValidEmail` function.
    Assert: Check that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Email length restriction ensures efficient storage and processing, and this test confirms adherence to that constraint.

---

Scenario 2: Empty Email String

Details:
  Description: Verify the functionâ€™s behavior when given an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an empty string as the email input.
    Act: Invoke the `IsValidEmail` function with the empty string.
    Assert: Ensure that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    An empty string doesn't meet email format standards, validating that the function rejects such input.

---

Scenario 3: Email Without Username

Details:
  Description: Test for an invalid email structure where the username part is missing.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an email string formatted as "@example.com".
    Act: Pass this string to `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    This test verifies the requirement for a valid username in an email format, ensuring input correctness.

---

Scenario 4: Email Without Domain

Details:
  Description: Check how the function handles an email missing the domain part.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Construct an email string like "user@".
    Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this string.
    Assert: Validate that the result is `false`.
  Validation:
    Valid domains are crucial. This test ensures that the function properly checks for domain presence.

---

Scenario 5: Email Without "@" Symbol

Details:
  Description: Assess function behavior for a string lacking the "@" character.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an email string such as "userexample.com".
    Act: Execute `IsValidEmail` with the prepared string.
    Assert: Verify that the return is `false`.
  Validation:
    The "@" symbol is essential in email formats. This test ensures this basic requirement is enforced.

---

Scenario 6: Valid Email with Special Characters

Details:
  Description: Assess the function capability to accept valid emails with special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an email like "user+name@example.co.uk".
    Act: Input this string into `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: Check the function returns `true`.
  Validation:
    Validating special characters ensures the function respects all standard email conventions.

---

Scenario 7: Valid Email with Subdomains

Details:
  Description: Confirm that the function correctly validates email addresses with subdomains.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Utilize an email format such as "user@sub.example.com".
    Act: Process this through `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: Expect a result of `true`.
  Validation:
    Subdomains are common, and this test checks that they're considered valid.

---

Scenario 8: Email with Forbidden Characters

Details:
  Description: Determine function response to emails containing forbidden characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Include forbidden characters in the email, e.g., "user<>name@example.com".
    Act: Insert this string into `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: Verify that it returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Ensuring forbidden characters are flagged upholds data integrity and security.

---

Scenario 9: All Lowercase Email

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a valid lowercase email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an email like "user@example.com".
    Act: Run this email through `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: The function should output `true`.
  Validation:
    Confirming basic valid inputs ensures the function operates accurately under normal conditions.

---

Scenario 10: Mixed Case Email

Details:
  Description: Evaluate function with a valid mixed-case email.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use "UsER@ExAmPle.Com" as the test case.
    Act: Feed this string into `IsValidEmail`.
    Assert: The expected result should be `true`.
  Validation:
    This test checks that case does not affect email validity, as per email standards.

---

These scenarios aim to cover a comprehensive range of email validation situations, ensuring the function operates correctly across typical, edge, and malformed cases.
