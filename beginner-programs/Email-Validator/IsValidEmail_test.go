================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Email Injection
Issue: The email validation function does not adequately check for email injection attacks. An attacker could potentially inject additional email addresses into the function, leading to unauthorized actions.
Solution: Implement a more robust email validation function using Go's built-in packages, such as 'net/mail'. This package provides a 'ParseAddress' function that can be used to validate email addresses and prevent email injection.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test valid email with a local part, "@" symbol, and domain part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a valid email address, which contains a local part, "@" symbol, and domain part.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a valid email address as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns true, indicating a valid email address.

Validation:
The email address used in this test is a standard, well-formed email address, which should be recognized as valid. This test ensures that the function correctly handles the most common case and validates the email address's syntax.

---

Scenario 2: Test email with a missing "@" symbol

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a missing "@" symbol.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address without the "@" symbol as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
The absence of the "@" symbol is a clear violation of the email address syntax, so this test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case.

---

Scenario 3: Test email with a missing local part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a missing local part.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address without the local part as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
The local part is a required component of an email address, so this test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case.

---

Scenario 4: Test email with a missing domain part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a missing domain part.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address without the domain part as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
The domain part is a required component of an email address, so this test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case.

---

Scenario 5: Test email with a length greater than 255 characters

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a length greater than 255 characters.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a length greater than 255 characters as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
The email address syntax limits the length of the local part, "@" symbol, and domain part to a maximum of 255 characters. This test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case and validates the email address's length.

---

Scenario 6: Test email with invalid characters in the local part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with invalid characters in the local part.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with invalid characters in the local part as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
The local part of an email address can only contain a limited set of characters, such as letters, digits, and special characters. This test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case and validates the local part's syntax.

---

Scenario 7: Test email with invalid characters in the domain part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with invalid characters in the domain part.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with invalid characters in the domain part as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
The domain part of an email address can only contain a limited set of characters, such as letters, digits, hyphens, and dots. This test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case and validates the domain part's syntax.

---

Scenario 8: Test email with a leading dot in the local part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a leading dot in the local part.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a leading dot in the local part as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
A leading dot is not allowed in the local part of an email address. This test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case and validates the local part's syntax.

---

Scenario 9: Test email with a trailing dot in the local part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with a trailing dot in the local part.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a trailing dot in the local part as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
A trailing dot is not allowed in the local part of an email address. This test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case and validates the local part's syntax.

---

Scenario 10: Test email with consecutive dots in the local part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an invalid email address with consecutive dots in the local part.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with consecutive dots in the local part as input.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the given input.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false, indicating an invalid email address.

Validation:
Consecutive dots are not allowed in the local part of an email address. This test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case and validates the local part's syntax.
