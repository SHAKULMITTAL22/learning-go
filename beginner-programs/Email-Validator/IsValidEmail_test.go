ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function `IsValidEmail` does not properly validate the length of the email input. It only checks if the length is greater than 255, but does not handle the case where the length is less than or equal to 0.
Solution: Add a check to ensure the length of the email is greater than 0 before performing any other validations.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash Without a Salt
Issue: The `regexp` package is used to validate email addresses, but it is not a secure method for handling email validation. It does not account for all possible valid email formats and can be easily bypassed by a determined attacker.
Solution: Use a more robust email validation library or method that accounts for all possible valid email formats and is harder to bypass. Consider using a well-maintained third-party library such as `govalidator`.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test a valid email address

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a valid email address.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a valid email address string.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address string as a parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses as required by the application's business logic.

---

Scenario 2: Test an empty email address

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an empty email address as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an empty string or a string with only whitespaces.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the empty string as a parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases where the email address is empty or contains only whitespaces.

---

Scenario 3: Test a long email address

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a long email address as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a string with more than 255 characters.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the long string as a parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases where the email address is too long, as specified in the RFC 5322.

---

Scenario 4: Test an email address with invalid characters

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address with invalid characters as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a string with invalid characters, such as special characters not allowed in email addresses.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the invalid string as a parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases where the email address contains invalid characters, as specified in the RFC 5322.

---

Scenario 5: Test an email address without an '@' symbol

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address without an '@' symbol as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a string with no '@' symbol.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the string as a parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles edge cases where the email address does not contain an '@' symbol, as it is required by the RFC 5322.
