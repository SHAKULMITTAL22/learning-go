Here are the existing test scenarios for the function, which are not considered while generating test cases 
undefined:
  [
    TestIsValidEmail
  ]### Scenario 1: Valid Email Format
Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies a properly formatted email address as valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a string representing a valid email address.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the valid email string.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function returns `true` for a valid email format, ensuring the email validation logic is correct. This test is crucial for user authentication or any process requiring valid email input.

### Scenario 2: Email Length Exceeds Maximum Limit
Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length limit (255 characters) as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a string for an email that is 256 characters long.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the overly long email string.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function enforces the maximum email length constraint, which is important for database storage optimization and preventing potential buffer overflow issues.

### Scenario 3: Email with Missing At-Symbol
Details:
  Description: Test to verify that the `IsValidEmail` function returns `false` for an email address missing the '@' symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a string that resembles an email but without the '@' symbol.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the function can identify missing critical components of an email address, which is essential for basic email format validation.

### Scenario 4: Email with Multiple At-Symbols
Details:
  Description: Ensure that the `IsValidEmail` function returns `false` for an email address containing more than one '@' symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a string that has multiple '@' symbols.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  Checking for multiple '@' symbols helps in confirming the function's ability to enforce proper email structure, which is vital for parsing and processing email addresses correctly.

### Scenario 5: Email with Special Characters in Domain
Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function returns `false` for emails with invalid characters in the domain part.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an email string with special characters in the domain section.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  It's important to confirm that the email validation logic correctly handles domain name constraints, ensuring compatibility with internet standards and preventing potential DNS issues.

### Scenario 6: Valid Email with Subdomain
Details:
  Description: Test to ensure that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies a valid email address that includes subdomains.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a valid email string that includes one or more subdomains.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `true`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function properly handles email addresses with complex domain structures, which is crucial for businesses and services that operate across various subdomains.

Each test scenario focuses on a specific aspect of the email validation function, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both typical usage and edge cases. This thorough testing is essential for maintaining the reliability and security of user input handling in applications.
