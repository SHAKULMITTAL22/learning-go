ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'IsValidEmail' does not properly validate the input email string, allowing emails longer than 255 characters to pass the check, which could lead to potential resource exhaustion or buffer overflow attacks.
Solution: Implement a more stringent input validation mechanism by checking for specific email format compliance, such as using the 'net/mail' package's 'ParseAddress' function, which can parse and validate the email format according to RFC 5322.

Vulnerability: CWE-77: Insecure Dependency
Issue: The 'regexp' package is an external dependency and may not be secure, potentially exposing the application to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS) attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the 'regexp' package is up-to-date and that any potential ReDOS vulnerabilities in the package have been addressed by the package maintainers. Additionally, consider limiting the maximum email length and using a more efficient regular expression that reduces the potential for ReDOS attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid email address

Details:
Description: Test the IsValidEmail function with a well-formed email address to ensure it returns true.

Execution:
Arrange: Declare a string variable containing a valid email address, e.g., "test@example.com".
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the argument.
Assert: Assert that the function returns true.

Validation:
The assertion ensures that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a valid email address. This test is crucial for verifying the basic functionality of the function and its ability to recognize well-formed email addresses.

---

Scenario 2: Empty email address

Details:
Description: Test the IsValidEmail function with an empty email address to ensure it returns false.

Execution:
Arrange: Declare a string variable containing an empty string.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the empty string as the argument.
Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion ensures that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an empty email address as invalid. This test covers an edge case and ensures that the function handles it gracefully.

---

Scenario 3: Email address longer than 255 characters

Details:
Description: Test the IsValidEmail function with an email address longer than 255 characters to ensure it returns false.

Execution:
Arrange: Declare a string variable containing an email address with more than 255 characters.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the long email address as the argument.
Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion ensures that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address longer than 255 characters as invalid. This test covers an edge case and ensures that the function handles it correctly.

---

Scenario 4: Email address without an '@' symbol

Details:
Description: Test the IsValidEmail function with an email address without an '@' symbol to ensure it returns false.

Execution:
Arrange: Declare a string variable containing an email address without an '@' symbol, e.g., "testexample.com".
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address as the argument.
Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion ensures that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address without an '@' symbol as invalid. This test covers an error handling scenario and ensures that the function handles it properly.

---

Scenario 5: Email address with multiple '@' symbols

Details:
Description: Test the IsValidEmail function with an email address containing multiple '@' symbols to ensure it returns false.

Execution:
Arrange: Declare a string variable containing an email address with multiple '@' symbols, e.g., "test@example.com@example.com".
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address as the argument.
Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion ensures that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address with multiple '@' symbols as invalid. This test covers an error handling scenario and ensures that the function handles it properly.
