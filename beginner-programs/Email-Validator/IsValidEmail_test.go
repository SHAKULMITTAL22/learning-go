Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

```
Scenario 1: Validate Maximum Length Email

Details:
  Description: Test to ensure that an email string that exceeds the maximum allowed length of 255 characters is rejected as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email string that has more than 255 characters.
  Act: Pass the created email string to the IsValidEmail function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns false, indicating the email is invalid.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function directly returns false if the email exceeds 255 characters, aligning with common email format restrictions.
  Discuss the importance of the test: This ensures compliance with typical email standards whereby email strings are traditionally capped at a certain length for database field compatibility.

Scenario 2: Validate Empty String

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the function handles and returns false for empty email strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty string to simulate the absence of an email address.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Confirm the function returns false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An empty string does not meet the criteria for a valid email format, thus should be rejected.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Handling empty inputs is essential for robustness, preventing potential bugs or crashes in other parts of the application utilizing email validation.

Scenario 3: Validate String Without '@' Symbol

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to detect invalid email formats which omit the '@' symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string that resembles an email but lacks the '@' symbol, such as "example.com".
  Act: Pass this string to the IsValidEmail function.
  Assert: Ensure it returns false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The absence of an '@' is a fundamental violation of the typical email pattern, indicating an invalid format.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Key to ensuring only appropriately structured emails are processed, thereby preventing invalid entries in user data.

Scenario 4: Validate String Without Domain Suffix

Details:
  Description: Check that the function identifies email addresses that lack a domain suffix, like ".com".
Execution:
  Arrange: Formulate a test email such as "user@domain".
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with this input.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An email without a domain suffix is incomplete and does not fit standard email criteria.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures comprehensive validation for full email addresses, reducing input errors or data integrity issues in databases.

Scenario 5: Validate String With Special Characters

Details:
  Description: Evaluate the functionâ€™s capability to handle unusual but valid email addresses with special characters within the local part.
Execution:
  Arrange: Utilize an email such as "user.name+alias@domain.com".
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with this email.
  Assert: Check that it returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: This format adheres to modern standards allowing special syntax in the local part of an email.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Vital for supporting a wide range of valid email formats consumers might utilize, enhancing flexibility and user-friendliness.

Scenario 6: Validate Correct Email with Subdomains

Details:
  Description: Test that the function correctly accepts a valid email that includes subdomains.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an email string such as "user@sub.domain.com".
  Act: Execute IsValidEmail with this string.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Subdomains are a legitimate aspect of email addresses, implying a valid structure.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Necessary to accurately capture valid organizations with complex domain hierarchies without false positives.

Scenario 7: Validate Numeric Domain Name

Details:
  Description: Make sure numeric domains are accepted as valid emails since they can frequently occur in practice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email address such as "user@123.com".
  Act: Feed this into IsValidEmail.
  Assert: Confirm the output is true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Numeric domains are legally and technically valid.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures the application remains compatible with contemporary domain naming conventions, avoiding unnecessary barriers to legitimate users.

Scenario 8: Validate Long Local Part

Details:
  Description: Test the function's response to emails with long local parts, which are technically permissible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate an email with a very long local part up to 64 characters, such as "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@domain.com".
  Act: Input this email into IsValidEmail.
  Assert: Observe that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Local parts can accommodate up to 64 characters, making the input valid according to specification boundaries.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Guarantees that emails are evaluated correctly even when they border on accepted lengths, minimizing incorrect rejections.

Scenario 9: Validate Multi-part Domain

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function confirms validity for emails with multiple-segment domains.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an email such as "user@sub.example.co.uk".
  Act: Use the IsValidEmail on this constructed email.
  Assert: Check if true is returned.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Multi-part domains represent valid structural elements in emails, reflecting real-world domain architectures.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures functionality supports a broad array of global and complex domain environments, catering to international standards and practices.
