ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'IsValidEmail' does not properly validate the input email, allowing for potential denial-of-service attacks due to the lack of length validation.
Solution: Implement a proper length check for the input email, ensuring that it does not exceed the maximum allowed length as per RFC 5321, which is 254 characters.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash Without a Salt
Issue: The 'emailRegexp' variable may be using a hardcoded regex pattern without a salt, making it vulnerable to potential brute-force attacks.
Solution: Consider using a salted hash function, such as bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt, to store and compare the email addresses securely.
