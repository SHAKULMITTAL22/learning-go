Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Here are several test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function:

```
Scenario 1: Validate Email with Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to verify that an email address with exactly 255 characters is valid. The function should return true because it checks for emails longer than 255 characters, not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid email address string with exactly 255 characters.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the constructed email address.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Since an email with exactly 255 characters is permitted, the expected result should be true. This ensures the function correctly handles edge cases at boundary limits.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Email length is a common constraint, and this test ensures that valid edge-case emails are accurately processed.

Scenario 2: Validate Email Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This test aims to verify that email addresses longer than 255 characters are deemed invalid. The function should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email address string with more than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function using the above email string.
  Assert: Check that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Emails exceeding the 255-character limit should be invalid, leading the function to return false. This ensures compliance with common email constraints.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensuring emails remain under a certain length is crucial for compatibility and to prevent potential buffer overflow issues.

Scenario 3: Validate Null or Empty Email

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's behavior when the input is an empty string, which is invalid and should be rejected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty string as the email input.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An empty email is inherently invalid, so the function should return false. This helps confirm basic validation logic is in place.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Handling null or empty input is critical in preventing unexpected behavior or application crashes.

Scenario 4: Validate Email with Invalid Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to reject email addresses with characters outside the valid set as defined by typical email standards.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email address containing spaces or invalid symbols.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Emails should adhere to common formats (e.g., no spaces), so the expected outcome is false. This test confirms the regex's effectiveness.
  Discuss the importance of the test: It is vital to ensure the function correctly identifies structurally flawed emails to maintain data integrity and prevent injection vulnerabilities.

Scenario 5: Validate Well-Formatted Email

Details:
  Description: This test is intended to validate that a properly formatted email address is accurately recognized as valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a standard well-formatted email like "example@domain.com."
  Act: Pass the email to the IsValidEmail function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: A correctly formatted email should naturally result in a true return value, verifying the function works under normal conditions.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensuring accurate validation of typical email formats is essential for the normal function of applications requiring user input.

Scenario 6: Validate Email with Subdomains

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to accept valid email addresses that include subdomains.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an email address with subdomains, such as "user@mail.example.com."
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with this email.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Email addresses often include subdomains, and if valid, should return true. It confirms the regex allows for complex domain structures.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Subdomains are common and the application should be able to handle them properly without marking them as invalid.
