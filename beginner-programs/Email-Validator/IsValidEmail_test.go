================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function `IsValidEmail` only checks if the email length is greater than 255, but it does not validate the email format according to RFC 5322.
Solution: Use a well-tested and secure email validation library, or implement a more comprehensive email validation function that checks for a valid format based on RFC 5322.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash Without a Salt
Issue: The `regexp` package is used without explicit versioning, which could lead to potential security issues if an outdated version is used with known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Specify the required version of the `regexp` package in the `go.mod` file to ensure that a secure version is always used.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test a valid email address

Details:
Description: Test the email validation function with a valid email address to ensure it returns true.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a variable with a valid email address string, e.g., "test@example.com".
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the valid email string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns true using Go testing facilities.

Validation:
The test is important to ensure that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies valid email addresses. This is a core functionality of the function, and the test verifies that the function behaves as expected under normal operating conditions.

---

Scenario 2: Test an empty email address

Details:
Description: Test the email validation function with an empty email address to ensure it returns false.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a variable with an empty string, e.g., "".
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the empty email string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false using Go testing facilities.

Validation:
The test is important to ensure that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies and rejects invalid email addresses, such as empty strings. This is a core functionality of the function, and the test verifies that the function behaves as expected under normal operating conditions.

---

Scenario 3: Test an email address with a length greater than 255 characters

Details:
Description: Test the email validation function with an email address longer than 255 characters to ensure it returns false.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a variable with an email string longer than 255 characters.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the long email string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false using Go testing facilities.

Validation:
The test is important to ensure that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies and rejects invalid email addresses, such as those longer than 255 characters. This is a core functionality of the function, and the test verifies that the function behaves as expected under normal operating conditions.

---

Scenario 4: Test an email address with an invalid format

Details:
Description: Test the email validation function with an email address that has an invalid format to ensure it returns false.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a variable with an email string that has an invalid format, e.g., "test@example".
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false using Go testing facilities.

Validation:
The test is important to ensure that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies and rejects invalid email addresses, such as those with an incorrect format. This is a core functionality of the function, and the test verifies that the function behaves as expected under normal operating conditions.

---

Scenario 5: Test a null email address

Details:
Description: Test the email validation function with a null email address to ensure it returns false.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a variable with a null value, e.g., nil.
Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the null email value.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false using Go testing facilities.

Validation:
The test is important to ensure that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies and rejects invalid email addresses, such as null values. This is a core functionality of the function, and the test verifies that the function behaves as expected under normal operating conditions.
