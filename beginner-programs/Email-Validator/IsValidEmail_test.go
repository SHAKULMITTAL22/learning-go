Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/email_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Scenario 1: Validate Empty Email String

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when an empty string is provided. It's crucial to ensure that such a case is handled correctly as it represents a lack of input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string as test data.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An empty string does not match the criteria for a valid email address and should return `false`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures robustness by confirming that no input is correctly recognized as invalid.

Scenario 2: Validate Maximum Length Email

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the behavior when the email is precisely 255 characters long, which is the maximum allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an email string that is exactly 255 characters long.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this valid long email.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `true`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An email of exactly 255 characters meets the length requirement and should be considered valid.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Confirms that boundary conditions for email length are correctly implemented.

Scenario 3: Validate Email Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's handling of emails exceeding 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email string with a length greater than 255 characters.
  Act: Pass this string to `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Emails should not exceed 255 characters, and the function should return `false` in such cases.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Validates that the function enforces the maximum length constraint accurately.

Scenario 4: Validate Email with Invalid Characters

Details:
  Description: This test ensures the function rejects emails containing invalid characters (e.g., spaces or special characters not permitted in email addresses).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an email including invalid characters.
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with this email.
  Assert: Check that the return value is `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Emails with inappropriate characters do not conform to standard email formats, so the function should identify them as invalid.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Prevents invalid email submissions, ensuring better data integrity and adherence to expected formats.

Scenario 5: Validate Valid Email with Subdomain

Details:
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly accepts valid emails that include subdomains.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a valid email containing a subdomain (e.g., `user@mail.example.com`).
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this email.
  Assert: Verify that the output is `true`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Emails with subdomains are common and should be handled as valid by the function.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures that common real-world email formats are accepted, enhancing the function's usefulness.

Scenario 6: Validate Email with Missing Domain

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies an email address missing a domain (e.g., `user@.com`) as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email missing the domain component.
  Act: Pass this email to `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Emails lacking a domain part are incomplete and should be rejected.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Helps maintain input quality by ensuring only properly formatted emails are accepted.

Scenario 7: Validate Email with Valid TLD

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to accept an email with a valid top-level domain (TLD).
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an email like `user@example.org`.
  Act: Call the function with this valid email.
  Assert: Check that it returns `true`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The email is formatted correctly, including a valid TLD, so it should be considered valid.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Confirms that valid domain structures are properly recognized, ensuring acceptance of a wide range of legitimate email formats.

Scenario 8: Validate Internationalized Email Address

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function handles internationalized email addresses correctly, though not fully supported by typical regex patterns.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an international email such as `ユーザー@例え.テスト`.
  Act: Pass this email to `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: Depending on regex capabilities, expect `false`, and assess need for detailed feature support.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Such addresses may require specific support beyond a basic regex pattern.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Highlights potential limitations and areas for enhancement if internationalization is required.

By covering these scenarios, we can ensure more comprehensive validation of the `IsValidEmail` function's behavior across a range of input variations.
