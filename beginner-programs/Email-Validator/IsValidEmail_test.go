================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function `IsValidEmail` does not check for invalid characters, potentially leading to injection attacks.
Solution: Add a check for invalid characters such as `<`, `>`, `;`, etc. or use a well-tested library for email validation.

Vulnerability: CWE-113: HTTP Request Splitting
Issue: The email address is not sanitized before being used in HTTP requests, possibly leading to HTTP Request Splitting attacks.
Solution: Sanitize the email address by removing any CR or LF characters before using it in HTTP requests.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Valid Email Address

Details:
Description: This test checks that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a valid email address as valid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a valid email address string.
Act: Invoke IsValidEmail with the valid email address.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the IsValidEmail function returns true.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses. This scenario covers the normal operation of the function.

---

Scenario 2: Test Empty String

Details:
Description: This test checks that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an empty string.
Act: Invoke IsValidEmail with the empty string.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the IsValidEmail function returns false.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the function handles empty strings correctly. This scenario covers an edge case that might occur in real-world usage.

---

Scenario 3: Test Long Email Address

Details:
Description: This test checks that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a valid but long email address as valid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a valid but long email address string (more than 255 characters).
Act: Invoke IsValidEmail with the valid but long email address.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the IsValidEmail function returns false.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles long email addresses. This scenario covers an edge case that might occur in real-world usage.

---

Scenario 4: Test Invalid Email Address

Details:
Description: This test checks that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address as invalid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an invalid email address string (incorrect format or missing parts).
Act: Invoke IsValidEmail with the invalid email address.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the IsValidEmail function returns false.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses. This scenario covers the normal operation of the function.

---

Scenario 5: Test Nil Email Address

Details:
Description: This test checks that the IsValidEmail function correctly handles a nil email address.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a nil string.
Act: Invoke IsValidEmail with the nil string.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the IsValidEmail function returns false.

Validation:
This test is important to ensure that the function handles nil strings correctly. This scenario covers an edge case that might occur in real-world usage.
