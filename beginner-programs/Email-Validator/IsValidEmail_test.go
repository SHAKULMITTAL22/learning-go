================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The email length check is the only input validation. This could allow malicious actors to cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing extremely long input strings.
Solution: Implement a more robust input validation mechanism, such as limiting the maximum input length before processing the email. Consider using a dedicated library for email validation, like 'net/mail', to ensure proper input validation.

Vulnerability: CWE-937: Use of Wrong Regular Expression in Email Validation
Issue: The regular expression used for email validation is not RFC 5322 compliant and may reject valid email addresses or accept invalid ones.
Solution: Replace the regular expression with a more comprehensive one compliant with RFC 5322, or use the 'net/mail' package for validating email addresses. This will increase the reliability of email validation and reduce the risk of allowing invalid email addresses.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Valid Email with a Common Domain

  Details:
    Description: Verify that IsValidEmail returns true for a valid email address with a common domain.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid email address with a common domain (e.g., "test@example.com").
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    This test checks the basic functionality of the IsValidEmail function, ensuring that it correctly identifies a valid email address.

Scenario 2: Test Empty Email

  Details:
    Description: Verify that IsValidEmail returns false for an empty email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty string as the email address.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    This test checks the error handling of the IsValidEmail function, ensuring that it correctly identifies an empty email address as invalid.

Scenario 3: Test Email with Invalid Length

  Details:
    Description: Verify that IsValidEmail returns false for an email address that exceeds the maximum length allowed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an email address that is longer than 255 characters with a valid format.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    This test checks the error handling of the IsValidEmail function, ensuring that it correctly identifies an email address that is too long as invalid.

Scenario 4: Test Email with Invalid Characters

  Details:
    Description: Verify that IsValidEmail returns false for an email address that contains invalid characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an email address that contains invalid characters, such as spaces, special characters, or multiple '@' symbols.
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    This test checks the error handling of the IsValidEmail function, ensuring that it correctly identifies an email address with invalid characters as invalid.

Scenario 5: Test Email with Non-Existent TLD

  Details:
    Description: Verify that IsValidEmail returns false for an email address with a non-existent top-level domain (TLD).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an email address with a non-existent TLD (e.g., "test@example.xyz123").
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    This test checks the error handling of the IsValidEmail function, ensuring that it correctly identifies an email address with a non-existent TLD as invalid.

Scenario 6: Test Email with Multiple '@' Symbols

  Details:
    Description: Verify that IsValidEmail returns false for an email address with multiple '@' symbols.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an email address with multiple '@' symbols (e.g., "test@example.com@example.com").
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    This test checks the error handling of the IsValidEmail function, ensuring that it correctly identifies an email address with multiple '@' symbols as invalid.

Scenario 7: Test Email with Consecutive Dots

  Details:
    Description: Verify that IsValidEmail returns false for an email address with consecutive dots.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an email address with consecutive dots (e.g., "test..example.com").
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    This test checks the error handling of the IsValidEmail function, ensuring that it correctly identifies an email address with consecutive dots as invalid.

Scenario 8: Test Email with Leading or Trailing Dots

  Details:
    Description: Verify that IsValidEmail returns false for an email address with leading or trailing dots.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an email address with leading or trailing dots (e.g., ".test@example.com" or "test@example.com.").
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    This test checks the error handling of the IsValidEmail function, ensuring that it correctly identifies an email address with leading or trailing dots as invalid.
