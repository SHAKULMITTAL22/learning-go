Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

```markdown
Scenario 1: Validate Short Email Addresses

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks if the function correctly identifies very short email addresses as valid. The email should contain the minimal required components for an email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a short email address such as "a@b.co".
  Act: Invoke IsValidEmail with the prepared email.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Short but correctly formed email addresses should be successfully validated by the function.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Ensures that the application does not mistakenly classify valid, albeit short, emails as invalid, which is crucial for accepting diverse user input.

Scenario 2: Validate Email Address with Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when handling an email address at the boundary of the allowed length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email string with exactly 255 characters.
  Act: Pass this string to IsValidEmail.
  Assert: Confirm the function returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. An email is at the length limit but correctly formed, so it should be accepted.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Ensures the function handles boundary conditions correctly, preventing accidental rejections based purely on length.

Scenario 3: Rejection of Email Address Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This scenario verifies that email addresses exceeding the 255 character limit are properly rejected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate an email string with a length of 256 characters.
  Act: Test this string using IsValidEmail.
  Assert: Expect the function to return false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Emails longer than the allowed max length should be rejected to adhere to email standards.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Prevents acceptance of overly long emails that could lead to data storage issues or client-side errors.

Scenario 4: Validate Email with Subdomain

Details:
  Description: Ensures that the function handles emails with subdomains correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an email like "user@mail.example.com".
  Act: Execute IsValidEmail with this email.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Subdomains are valid and common in email addresses, ensuring realistic acceptance.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Supports diverse domain structures typical in business and personal email environments.

Scenario 5: Rejection of Email without Domain

Details:
  Description: Verify that emails lacking a domain portion are correctly rejected as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address in the form "user@localhost".
  Act: Pass this address to IsValidEmail.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Emails need a complete domain to ensure proper sending and receiving.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Prevents incorrect formatting that could lead to delivery errors.

Scenario 6: Rejection of Email with Special Characters Outside Local Part

Details:
  Description: Ensures emails with special characters outside the local part are rejected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an email like "user@exa!m.ple.com".
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with this email.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. Ensures compliance with RFC standards that restrict special character usage.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements. Necessary for maintaining standard-compliant and service-compatible email validation.
