================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The email length check `if len(email) > 255` is performed after the regular expression match, potentially allowing an attacker to perform a ReDOS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack.
Solution: Perform the email length check before the regular expression match to ensure that overly long input is rejected before the regular expression is evaluated.

Vulnerability: CWE-693: Unvalidated Regular Expression
Issue: The regular expression `emailRegexp` is not defined in the provided code snippet, making it difficult to evaluate its correctness and completeness. An attacker may be able to craft malicious input that bypasses the regular expression check.
Solution: Ensure that the regular expression `emailRegexp` is defined and validated in the code. It is recommended to use a well-tested and established regular expression for email validation, such as the one provided in the Go standard library's `net/mail` package.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Normal Operation - Valid Email Address

  Details:
    Description: Test if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a valid email address.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid email address, e.g., "user@example.com".
    Act: Call IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
    Assert: Check if the function returns true.

  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: The IsValidEmail function should correctly identify a valid email address and return true.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test is essential to ensure that the IsValidEmail function works as expected for regular email addresses, providing confidence in the application's functionality.

---

Scenario 2: Normal Operation - Email with Subdomain

  Details:
    Description: Test if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a valid email address with a subdomain.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid email address with a subdomain, e.g., "user.bob@example.com".
    Act: Call IsValidEmail function with the valid email address with a subdomain.
    Assert: Check if the function returns true.

  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: The IsValidEmail function should correctly identify a valid email address with a subdomain and return true.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test is essential to ensure that the IsValidEmail function can handle various valid email addresses, including those with subdomains.

---

Scenario 3: Edge Case - Maximum Email Address Length

  Details:
    Description: Test if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a valid email address with the maximum length.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid email address with the maximum length of 255 characters.
    Act: Call IsValidEmail function with the valid email address with the maximum length.
    Assert: Check if the function returns true.

  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: The IsValidEmail function should correctly identify a valid email address with the maximum length and return true.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test ensures that the IsValidEmail function can handle the maximum email address length as specified in the RFC 5322 standard.

---

Scenario 4: Edge Case - Empty Email Address

  Details:
    Description: Test if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an empty email address as invalid.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an empty string as an email address.
    Act: Call IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
    Assert: Check if the function returns false.

  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: The IsValidEmail function should correctly identify an empty email address as invalid and return false.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test ensures that the IsValidEmail function can handle empty email addresses, which are invalid according to the RFC 5322 standard.

---

Scenario 5: Error Handling - Email Address Longer Than 255 Characters

  Details:
    Description: Test if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address longer than 255 characters as invalid.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a string longer than 255 characters as an email address.
    Act: Call IsValidEmail function with the overly long email address.
    Assert: Check if the function returns false.

  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: The IsValidEmail function should correctly identify an email address longer than 255 characters as invalid and return false.
    Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test ensures that the IsValidEmail function can handle overly long email addresses and provide accurate results, even in exceptional cases.
