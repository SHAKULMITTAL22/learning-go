================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The input validation function IsValidEmail() only checks if the email length is greater than 255, but it does not verify if the email is a well-formed email address following the RFC 5322 standard.
Solution: Use a regular expression that checks for a well-formed email address as per the RFC 5322 standard. You can use the regular expression provided in the Golang standard library's net/mail package: `const EmailRegexp = "^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$`.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Empty email string

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with an empty string as input to ensure it returns false.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with an empty string.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the edge case of an empty email string correctly. It is important to ensure that the function does not accept invalid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

2. Scenario: Very long email string

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with a very long string as input to ensure it returns false.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with a very long string.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the edge case of a very long email string correctly. It is important to ensure that the function does not accept invalid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

3. Scenario: Email with no '@' symbol

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with an email string that does not contain an '@' symbol to ensure it returns false.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with an email string that does not contain an '@' symbol.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the edge case of an email string without an '@' symbol correctly. It is important to ensure that the function does not accept invalid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

4. Scenario: Email with multiple '@' symbols

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with an email string that contains multiple '@' symbols to ensure it returns false.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with an email string that contains multiple '@' symbols.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the edge case of an email string with multiple '@' symbols correctly. It is important to ensure that the function does not accept invalid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

5. Scenario: Valid email address

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with a valid email string to ensure it returns true.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with a valid email string.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the normal operation of a valid email string correctly. It is important to ensure that the function accepts valid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

6. Scenario: Email with invalid domain

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with an email string that contains an invalid domain to ensure it returns false.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with an email string that contains an invalid domain.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the edge case of an email string with an invalid domain correctly. It is important to ensure that the function does not accept invalid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

7. Scenario: Email with invalid local-part

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with an email string that contains an invalid local-part to ensure it returns false.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with an email string that contains an invalid local-part.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the edge case of an email string with an invalid local-part correctly. It is important to ensure that the function does not accept invalid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

8. Scenario: Email with special characters

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with an email string that contains special characters to ensure it returns true if the characters are valid.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with an email string that contains special characters.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns true if the characters are valid.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the edge case of an email string with special characters correctly. It is important to ensure that the function accepts valid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

9. Scenario: Email with uppercase characters

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with an email string that contains uppercase characters to ensure it returns true.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with an email string that contains uppercase characters.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
   Validation:
   This test case is essential because it checks that the function handles the case sensitivity of email strings correctly. It is important to ensure that the function accepts valid input, and this test case validates that behavior.

10. Scenario: Email with multiple dots

   Details:
   Description: Test the function with an email string that contains multiple dots to ensure it returns true if the dots are valid.
   Execution:
   Arrange: Create a variable with an email string that contains multiple dots.
   Act: Pass the variable as an argument to the IsValidEmail function.
   Assert: Assert that the function returns true if the dots are valid.
