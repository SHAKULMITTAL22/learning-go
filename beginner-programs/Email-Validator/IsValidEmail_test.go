================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: cwe-20: improper input validation
Issue: the regex only checks format and not the actual domain existence which might allow invalid emails
Solution: extend validation to include checking the domain against a list of known valid domains or use a third-party service to validate the email address

Vulnerability: regex denial of service (redos)
Issue: using regex for email validation can be vulnerable to redos when processing crafted inputs taking excessive time
Solution: avoid complex regex and consider using a simpler method or third-party libraries for input validation

Vulnerability: cwe-307: improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts
Issue: not directly related to the provided function, but the lack of protection against brute-force attacks for email address verification poses a threat
Solution: implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms in higher-level authentication logic

================================================================================
Based on the contents of the file `email.go` from the `Email-Validator` directory, we can see that the IsValidEmail function is part of the package named `Validator`. It uses a regular expression to validate the local and domain parts of email addresses.

Now, I will proceed to create several test scenarios for the `IsValidEmail` function. We will cover a range of tests, including checks for valid email addresses, various invalid email formats, edge cases such as extremely long email addresses, and email addresses that just barely conform to the standards.

Scenario 1: Valid Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithValidEmail
  Description: This test verifies that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies valid email addresses. The primary focus is to ensure that commonly accepted email formats are correctly validated as true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a valid email address string to be tested.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the predefined valid email address.
  Assert: Use `if IsValidEmail(email) != true { t.Errorf(...) }` to assert that the result should be true for a valid email address.
Validation:
  Justify: According to common email format standards, the provided string meets the criteria for a valid email address, which IsValidEmail should recognize.
  Importance: Ensuring the function correctly validates valid email addresses is essential for user registration and communication.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Address Due to Strange Characters

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithInvalidCharacters
  Description: This test examines whether IsValidEmail correctly identifies email addresses with invalid characters as false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an invalid email address string containing unusual, prohibited characters.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the predefined invalid email address.
  Assert: Use `if IsValidEmail(email) != false { t.Errorf(...) }` to expect that the result should be false for an email address containing invalid characters.
Validation:
  Justify: The presence of unacceptable characters in the email address breaks the standard email format rules and thus should return false.
  Importance: It's important to prevent accepting emails with characters that may cause issues in processing or security vulnerabilities.

Scenario 3: Invalid Email Address With Missing At-Symbol

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailMissingAtSymbol
  Description: This test focuses on asserting that the IsValidEmail function returns false for email addresses that lack the "@" symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an email string without an "@" symbol.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with this string.
  Assert: Check for a false return value using `if IsValidEmail(email) != false { t.Errorf(...) }`.
Validation:
  Justify: For an email to be valid, it must include the "@" symbol separating local and domain parts, so the function should return false.
  Importance: This scenario checks a fundamental rule of email address structure and assures that basic validation is enforced.

Scenario 4: Invalid Email Address Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailExceedsMaxLength
  Description: This test validates that the IsValidEmail function rejects email addresses exceeding the maximum length as specified in the function's logic (e.g., 255 characters).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email string longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the lengthy email string.
  Assert: Use `if IsValidEmail(email) != false { t.Errorf(...) }` to assert a false outcome.
Validation:
  Justify: Email standards typically set a maximum length; the function includes a specific check for this, and exceeding the limit should result in validation failure.
  Importance: This test ensures the function enforces email length restrictions to maintain compatibility with email standards and prevent potential overflow issues.

Scenario 5: Valid Email Address With Maximum Length

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailAtMaxLength
  Description: This test scenario ensures that the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address at the maximum allowable length as valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid email address string that is exactly 255 characters long.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with this email address.
  Assert: Check that the function returns true, using `if IsValidEmail(email) != true { t.Errorf(...) }`.
Validation:
  Justify: An email address at 255 characters is within the acceptable range, and the function should recognize it as such, provided the structure is valid.
  Importance: This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly reject long but valid email addresses, which would be a false negative scenario affecting users with legitimately long email addresses.

These are just a few test scenarios that could be developed further with actual Go code, including test functions and detailed assertions. It's important to create a comprehensive test suite that covers as many edge cases as possible to ensure the robustness and reliability of the `IsValidEmail` function.
