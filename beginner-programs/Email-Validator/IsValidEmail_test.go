================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not properly validate the length of the input email, allowing a potential attacker to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by providing an email address longer than 255 characters.
Solution: Add proper input validation to ensure that the length of the email is within acceptable limits before performing any further checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-730: Exposed Regular Expression
Issue: The regular expression used for email validation is exposed, which could potentially lead to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack if the regular expression is complex and the input is maliciously crafted.
Solution: Consider using a precompiled regular expression or a well-tested third-party library for email validation to minimize the risk of ReDoS attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Valid Email with Standard Format

Details:
Description: Check if the IsValidEmail function correctly validates a standard email address format.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a valid email address, e.g., "example@example.com".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address as a parameter.
Assert: Assert that the function returns true.

Validation:
This test scenario is important because it validates the basic functionality of the IsValidEmail function. A valid email address should return true, indicating that the function correctly identifies properly formatted email addresses.

---

Scenario 2: Test Empty String

Details:
Description: Check if the IsValidEmail function handles an empty string.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an empty string as the email address.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string as a parameter.
Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
This test scenario is important because it tests the function's ability to handle edge cases. An empty string is an invalid email address and should return false, indicating that the function correctly identifies this edge case.

---

Scenario 3: Test Email Longer Than 255 Characters

Details:
Description: Check if the IsValidEmail function handles email addresses longer than 255 characters.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with more than 255 characters.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address as a parameter.
Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
This test scenario is important because it tests the function's ability to handle edge cases. According to RFC 3696, an email address should be no longer than 255 characters. This test case ensures that the IsValidEmail function adheres to this standard.

---

Scenario 4: Test Email With Special Characters

Details:
Description: Check if the IsValidEmail function correctly validates an email address with special characters.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with special characters, e.g., "test!#$%&'*+-/=?^_`{|}~<EMAIL>".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address containing special characters as a parameter.
Assert: Assert that the function returns true.

Validation:
This test scenario is important because it validates the function's ability to handle email addresses with special characters. Special characters are allowed in email addresses as per RFC 3696, and this test case checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies such email addresses as valid.

---

Scenario 5: Test Email Without @ Symbol

Details:
Description: Check if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address without an @ symbol as invalid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address without an @ symbol, e.g., "example.example.com".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address without an @ symbol as a parameter.
Assert: Assert that the function returns false.

Validation:
This test scenario is important because it validates the function's ability to handle email addresses without an @ symbol, which is a required character in email addresses. This test case checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies such email addresses as invalid.
