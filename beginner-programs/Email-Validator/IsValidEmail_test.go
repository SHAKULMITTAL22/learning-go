ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not check if the email length is greater than 0 before checking if it's greater than 255, which could lead to an index out of range error.
Solution: Add a check to ensure the email length is greater than 0 before checking if it's greater than 255.

Vulnerability: CWE-77: Insecure Dependency Function
Issue: The code uses the `regexp.MatchString` function, which is a potential security risk as it can consume a lot of memory and CPU resources for complex regular expressions, potentially leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Consider using a compiled regular expression with the `regexp.MustCompile` function, or limit the input size to prevent resource exhaustion.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check if a valid email address passes the validation

Details:
Description: This test checks whether a valid email address, which conforms to the standard email format, passes the validation.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a valid email address as a string variable.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the prepared email address as an argument.
Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a valid email address, ensuring that the email format validation logic is working as expected.

---

Scenario 2: Check if a blank email address fails the validation

Details:
Description: This test checks whether a blank email address fails the validation, ensuring that the function correctly rejects empty strings.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an empty string as a variable.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string as an argument.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a blank email address, ensuring that the function handles edge cases properly.

---

Scenario 3: Check if an email address exceeding the maximum length limit fails the validation

Details:
Description: This test checks whether an email address exceeding the maximum length limit (255 characters) fails the validation.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a length greater than 255 characters as a variable.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the excessively long email address as an argument.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an email address exceeding the maximum length limit, ensuring that the function handles edge cases and adheres to the specified constraints.

---

Scenario 4: Check if a local part of the email address exceeding the maximum length limit fails the validation

Details:
Description: This test checks whether a local part of an email address exceeding the maximum length limit (64 characters) fails the validation.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a local part exceeding 64 characters as a variable.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address having a long local part as an argument.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an email address with a local part exceeding the maximum length limit, ensuring that the function handles edge cases and adheres to the specified constraints.

---

Scenario 5: Check if a non-compliant email address fails the validation

Details:
Description: This test checks whether a non-compliant email address (not adhering to the standard email format) fails the validation.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a non-compliant email address (e.g., without '@' or having multiple '@') as a variable.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the non-compliant email address as an argument.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a non-compliant email address, ensuring that the email format validation logic is working as expected.
