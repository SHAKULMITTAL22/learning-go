Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/email_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

### Scenario 1: Valid Email Format

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies a properly formatted email address as valid. This includes checking typical email formats like `name@domain.com`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string with a valid email format.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the defined valid email string.
  Assert: The function should return true, indicating the email is valid.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function returns true for a valid email format, which is crucial for allowing users to proceed with email-based operations in the application. Ensuring only valid emails are accepted helps maintain data integrity and reduces issues related to communication or identity management.

### Scenario 2: Invalid Email Format

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the `IsValidEmail` function accurately identifies an improperly formatted email address as invalid. Examples include missing '@' symbol, no domain, and special characters that are not typically allowed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string with an invalid email format.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the defined invalid email string.
  Assert: The function should return false, indicating the email is not valid.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the function rejects invalid email formats, which is important for preventing incorrect data entry. This helps avoid potential issues in user communication and system processes that rely on valid email addresses.

### Scenario 3: Email Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum allowed length (255 characters) as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string that is a valid email format but longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the overly long email string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  Asserting that the function returns false for overly long emails ensures that the application can handle and reject input that could potentially cause storage or processing issues. It is important for maintaining performance and avoiding buffer overflow errors.

### Scenario 4: Email at Maximum Length Boundary

Details:
  Description: Test the function with an email address that is exactly at the maximum length limit to ensure it is treated as valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string that is a valid email format and exactly 255 characters long.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the email string.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation:
  This test checks the boundary condition at the maximum length limit. The assertion that the function returns true for a 255-character email confirms that the application correctly handles edge cases regarding length constraints.

### Scenario 5: Empty Email String

Details:
  Description: Verify that the `IsValidEmail` function treats an empty string as an invalid email.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty string for the email.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  The assertion is crucial to ensure that the system correctly handles cases where no email is entered, preventing further processing of such entries and maintaining the robustness of the application's data validation processes.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `IsValidEmail` function behaves correctly across a variety of typical and edge cases, maintaining the application's reliability and user trust.
