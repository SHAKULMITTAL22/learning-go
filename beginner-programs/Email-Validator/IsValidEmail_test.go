================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The email validation function `IsValidEmail` does not properly validate the input, as it only checks the length and matches it against a regular expression. This can lead to potential security issues such as email spoofing or email injection.
Solution: Implement a more robust email validation mechanism, considering the RFC 5322 standard for email addresses. Additionally, consider using a well-tested library for email validation, such as `github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation`.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash Without a Salt
Issue: Although not directly visible in the provided code snippet, it is important to ensure that if the `emailRegexp` variable is initialized using a hardcoded string, it may pose a security risk if the regular expression contains sensitive information or is used in a security-critical context. This is because Go's `regexp` package uses a one-way hash without a salt to cache compiled regular expressions, which can lead to potential preimage attacks.
Solution: To mitigate this risk, consider initializing the `emailRegexp` variable using a dynamic or runtime-generated regular expression, or ensure that the hardcoded regular expression does not contain sensitive information or is not used in a security-critical context.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for a valid email address

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that a valid email address is correctly identified as such.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a valid email address, e.g., "test@example.com".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies valid email addresses, as it is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test for an empty email address

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an empty email address is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an empty string.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as an empty email address, correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for an email address with a length greater than 255 characters

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an email address with a length greater than 255 characters is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a length greater than 255 characters.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as an email address with a length greater than 255 characters, correctly.

Scenario 4: Test for an email address without an '@' symbol

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an email address without an '@' symbol is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address without an '@' symbol, e.g., "testexample.com".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses, as it is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 5: Test for an email address without a domain

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an email address without a domain is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address without a domain, e.g., "test@".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses, as it is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 6: Test for an email address with an invalid top-level domain

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an email address with an invalid top-level domain is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with an invalid top-level domain, e.g., "test@example.c".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses, as it is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 7: Test for an email address with a valid top-level domain but invalid domain name

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an email address with a valid top-level domain but invalid domain name is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a valid top-level domain but invalid domain name, e.g., "test@example..com".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses, as it is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 8: Test for an email address with a valid top-level domain and domain name but invalid local part

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an email address with a valid top-level domain and domain name but invalid local part is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a valid top-level domain and domain name but invalid local part, e.g., "te st@example.com".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses, as it is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 9: Test for an email address with a valid top-level domain, domain name, and local part but invalid characters

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an email address with a valid top-level domain, domain name, and local part but invalid characters is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a valid top-level domain, domain name, and local part but invalid characters, e.g., "test@example.com-".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses, as it is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 10: Test for an email address with a valid top-level domain, domain name, and local part but invalid format

Details:
Description: Test to ensure that an email address with a valid top-level domain, domain name, and local part but invalid format is correctly identified as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a valid top-level domain, domain name, and local part but invalid format, e.g., "test@example.com..".
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation: This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid email addresses, as it is the core functionality of the function.
