File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/email_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

Scenario 1: Test Email Length Exceeding 255 Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `IsValidEmail` function when the email string exceeds the maximum allowed length of 255 characters. The function should return `false` in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string with more than 255 characters, ensuring it resembles an email format.
  Act: Pass this long email string as the argument to `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: An email longer than 255 characters is not considered valid according to standard specifications, justifying the `false` result.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures that the function properly handles overly long inputs, preventing potential validation issues or application errors.

Scenario 2: Test Exact 255 Characters Valid Email

Details:
  Description: This test confirms the function's capability to accurately assess an email address that is exactly 255 characters long for validity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a valid email address exactly 255 characters in length (including domain and "@" sign).
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this email.
  Assert: Validate that the function returns `true`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: As the length meets boundary requirements and is a valid format, it should return `true`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Verifies correct behavior at an important boundary condition for valid input sizes.

Scenario 3: Test Invalid Email Format Without "@" Symbol

Details:
  Description: Determine if the function can properly reject emails that lack the "@" symbol, which is a fundamental part of any email format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email string that is otherwise valid but omits the "@" symbol.
  Act: Use `IsValidEmail` to evaluate this string.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Email formats must have an "@"; lack thereof renders it invalid, necessitating a `false` result.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Guards against form submissions or data storage containing structurally invalid emails.

Scenario 4: Test Invalid Email Format Without Domain Part

Details:
  Description: This test examines whether the function correctly identifies an invalid email that does not have a domain portion following the "@" symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email string that includes an "@" but no domain post it, like "user@".
  Act: Input this string into `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: A missing domain is a clear formatting error, validating the `false` outcome.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures robustness of email verification logic in distinguishing malformed inputs.

Scenario 5: Test Empty Email String

Details:
  Description: This scenario checks the function's handling of empty string inputs, which should be deemed invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty string as the test input.
  Act: Test this input with `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Empty strings cannot be valid emails; thus, the function must return `false`.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Essential for basic input validation and to prevent null/empty abuses in data handling.

Scenario 6: Test Valid Email Format at Valid Minimum Length

Details:
  Description: Evaluates if the function can recognize a valid email address structure at a minimum feasible length, like "a@b.co".
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid email string of minimal size that includes both an "@" and a domain.
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` on this minimal valid email string.
  Assert: Ensure the function results in `true`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Despite its shortness, it satisfies the criteria of a valid email format.
  Discuss the importance of the test: Vital to validate function's allowance for valid emails regardless of succinct format.
