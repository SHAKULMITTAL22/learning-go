================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: input validation
Issue: the email validator uses regex to validate email addresses and does not check for the presence of control characters, which could be potentially used in header injection attacks
Solution: update the regex to exclude control characters and use a more comprehensive validation library designed for email verification, such as golang.org/x/net/idna

Vulnerability: denial of service (regex complexity)
Issue: the regex used in IsValidEmail is potentially vulnerable to ReDoS attacks where certain email strings can cause excessive backtracking leading to cpu exhaustion
Solution: avoid complex regex patterns and limit the input size, or replace the regex-based validation with a more performant and less complex algorithm

Vulnerability: length check
Issue: the length check for an email string is done after regex validation, which can allow unnecessarily long strings to be evaluated
Solution: move the length check for the email string to be the first check before the regex evaluation to prevent processing of overly long strings

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailValidAddress
  Description: The test examines the IsValidEmail function with a standard, properly formatted email address to check if it returns true.
Execution:
  Arrange: An email string that is compliant with typical email format conventions.
  Act: Pass the email string to the IsValidEmail function.
  Assert: Use the standard Go `testing` package to assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Justify: An email address that follows normal conventions should be recognized as valid.
  Importance: Ensures that the application correctly identifies legitimate email addresses, crucial for user account validation and communication.

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Address

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailInvalidAddress
  Description: The test assesses the IsValidEmail function with an improperly formatted email address to check if it returns false.
Execution:
  Arrange: An email string that does not comply with email format conventions (e.g., missing '@' sign).
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the invalid email string.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Justify: An email address without the proper structure should not be valid.
  Importance: Validates the function's ability to guard against incorrect email formats, preventing invalid data from entering the system.

Scenario 3: Email Address Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailExceedingMaxLength
  Description: The test inspects whether the IsValidEmail function correctly handles email addresses exceeding the maximum length of 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate an email string longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with this long email string.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Justify: Emails exceeding maximum allowed length should be considered invalid as per typical email server standards.
  Importance: Prevents the storage or processing of excessively long email addresses, which could cause issues with database storage or communication protocols.

Scenario 4: Valid Email Address with Uncommon Characters

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailUncommonChars
  Description: This test ensures that IsValidEmail function correctly validates email addresses that include special or less common characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email string containing special characters that are valid in an email address.
  Act: Execute the IsValidEmail function using this email string.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Justify: According to RFC standards, specific special characters are allowed within the local part of an email address.
  Importance: This test confirms the regex pattern used is permissive enough to include all valid email address characters, reflecting real-world email address variations.

Scenario 5: Empty Email Address String

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailEmptyString
  Description: The test checks the response of IsValidEmail function when provided with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Utilize an empty string as the email input.
  Act: Pass this empty string to the IsValidEmail function.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns false.
Validation:
  Justify: An empty string does not represent a valid email address structure.
  Importance: Helps to confirm that the system will not process or store blank emails, preventing potential mishandling of user data or system errors.

These scenarios provide a comprehensive test suite that should cover both typical and unusual cases encountered by the `IsValidEmail` function, ensuring robust validation is applied to email addresses in the application.
