Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

```markdown
Scenario 1: Test with a Valid Email Address

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a standard valid email address format.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a string containing a typical valid email address, such as "user@example.com".
    Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this valid email string.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `true`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The test asserts `true` because the email format meets the general criteria for a valid email, conforming to common patterns.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures that the function correctly recognizes valid emails, which is crucial for user registration and communication features.

Scenario 2: Test with an Email Address Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function rejects email addresses exceeding the specified maximum length of 255 characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an email string longer than 255 characters, such as "a...@example.com" (repeated 'a' to exceed the limit).
    Act: Invoke the `IsValidEmail` function with this long email string.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return `false` since the email length exceeds the allowable limit.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Validates that the function enforces email length constraints to prevent buffer overruns or database storage issues.

Scenario 3: Test with an Email Address Missing an "@" Symbol

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to identify an invalid email format that lacks the "@" symbol, a crucial part of any valid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an invalid email string like "userexample.com" which lacks an "@" symbol.
    Act: Pass this invalid email to the `IsValidEmail` function.
    Assert: Ensure the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return `false` because the absence of "@" invalidates the email format.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures that the function correctly flags emails missing essential structural components.

Scenario 4: Test with an Email Address Missing a Domain

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's ability to detect email addresses that are missing a domain part.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare an email like "user@", which lacks a domain after the "@" symbol.
    Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this incomplete email.
    Assert: Check that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return `false` as the absence of a domain part makes the email invalid.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Confirms that the function can identify emails that are structurally incomplete.

Scenario 5: Test with an Email Address Containing Special Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can correctly handle email addresses with special characters, which are allowed in certain parts of an email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use a valid email string like "user.name+tag@example.co.uk" that includes special characters.
    Act: Invoke the `IsValidEmail` function with this specially formatted email.
    Assert: Validate that the function returns `true`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return `true` because special characters in the local part are acceptable under certain conditions.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Ensures the function's robustness in handling diverse valid email formats.

Scenario 6: Test with an Empty Email String

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when given an empty string, which is not a valid email.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an empty string as input to the test.
    Act: Pass this empty string to the `IsValidEmail` function.
    Assert: Check that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should return `false` as an empty string cannot be a valid email.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Confirms that the function correctly handles edge cases like empty inputs, which could otherwise lead to unexpected behavior.
