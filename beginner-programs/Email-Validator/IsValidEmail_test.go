  [
    TestIsValidEmail
  ]

### Scenario 1: Valid Email Format

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies a properly formatted email address as valid. This includes checking typical email formats like `name@domain.com`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string with a valid email format.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the arranged email string.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function returns `true` for a valid email format, which is crucial for allowing users to proceed with email-based operations like registration or notifications. The correctness of this functionality is directly related to user management and communication features in applications.

### Scenario 2: Email Exceeding Maximum Length

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the `IsValidEmail` function returns `false` for an email address that exceeds the maximum length constraint (255 characters). This is important to validate to prevent database or UI overflow errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a string that is longer than 255 characters but otherwise a valid email format.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the long email string.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function enforces length constraints, which is essential for data integrity and avoiding buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The assertion for `false` ensures that excessively long emails are correctly identified as invalid.

### Scenario 3: Email with Missing Domain

Details:
  Description: Checks if the `IsValidEmail` function identifies an email missing the domain part (e.g., `username@`) as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that represents an email without a domain.
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Asserting `false` verifies that the function properly validates email structure, including the presence of a domain after the '@' symbol. This test is important to ensure that all components of the email are present for successful email operations.

### Scenario 4: Email with Invalid Characters

Details:
  Description: Tests whether `IsValidEmail` flags an email containing special characters that are typically not allowed (e.g., `user!name@domain.com`).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string with an email that includes invalid characters.
  Act: Execute `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  The function should recognize and invalidate emails with characters that do not conform to typical email standards. This validation is crucial for maintaining data consistency and preventing injection vulnerabilities.

### Scenario 5: Empty Email String

Details:
  Description: Ensures that `IsValidEmail` returns `false` when provided with an empty string, as an email cannot be empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty string as the input.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the empty string.
  Assert: Confirm that the output is `false`.
Validation:
  Testing with an empty string checks the function's ability to handle and reject incomplete or missing data. This is vital for ensuring that all user inputs are valid and meaningful in the context of the application.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases that help ensure the robustness and reliability of the `IsValidEmail` function in handling different email formats and constraints.
