```markdown
Scenario 1: Valid Email Format

Details:
  Description: This scenario checks if the function correctly identifies a valid email address format, using a standard email structure within the typical length boundaries.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a valid email string, such as "test@example.com".
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with the arranged email string.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. The assertion is designed to confirm that the function can recognize typical email structures, adhering to common email formatting rules. This test is essential because a fundamental requirement is the ability to identify valid email formats. Email validation is crucial for functions needing reliable user contact information.

Scenario 2: Excessively Long Email Address

Details:
  Description: This test aims to verify that the function returns false for emails exceeding the maximum allowed length of 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an email address string with more than 255 characters.
  Act: Pass the exceedingly long email to the IsValidEmail function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function output is false.
Validation:
  This assertion validates input length handling, ensuring the function enforces length limitations necessary to conform with typical email specifications. It prevents processing excessively long inputs that could lead to performance issues or buffer overflows.

Scenario 3: Invalid Email Format (Missing '@' Symbol)

Details:
  Description: This test is intended to detect malformed email addresses missing the '@' symbol, which is crucial for valid email addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an email string without an '@', such as "invalidemail.com".
  Act: Execute IsValidEmail with the malformed email.
  Assert: Verify that the function result is false.
Validation:
  Through this assertion, the test checks the function's capacity to identify format violations, safeguarding correct email syntax. It's vital to capture these errors to prevent sending emails to incorrect addresses, upholding data integrity.

Scenario 4: Invalid Email Format (Missing Domain Part)

Details:
  Description: This scenario evaluates the function's response to an email string that lacks the domain portion following the '@' symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a string like "user@" as the test email.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with this input.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns false.
Validation:
  This assertion checks for proper email partitioning, ensuring both local and domain parts comply with requirements. Correctly formatted emails are essential for reliable email communications and application functionality.

Scenario 5: Valid Email with Special Characters

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to process emails with permitted special characters, like dots and plus signs, within valid usage context.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a valid email with special characters, e.g., "user.test+label@example.com".
  Act: Invoke the function with the email.
  Assert: Check for a return value of true.
Validation:
  Verifying this aspect ensures the function accommodates valid email permutations that adhere to syntax rules while preventing misinterpretations that could exclude genuine email variations. This supports diverse user inputs and broadens application usability.

Scenario 6: Invalid Email with Unbalanced Quotes

Details:
  Description: This test inspects how the function handles emails with improperly placed quotes, rendering them invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string like "incorrect"email@example.com", which has mismatched quotes.
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with this input.
  Assert: Confirm that the output is false.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's capacity to identify improper character usage, integral to preventing errors from improper input processing and ensuring email compliance with the expected standard.

Scenario 7: Valid Maximum Length Email

Details:
  Description: This scenario verifies the function's ability to validate an email of exactly 255 characters, the maximum permissible length for valid emails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string that simulates a valid email with precisely 255 characters.
  Act: Pass this string to IsValidEmail.
  Assert: Confirm that the function correctly returns true.
Validation:
  This check ensures boundary conditions handling, particularly critical for ensuring the function's effectiveness against maximum expected input sizes without cutting off valid data. It is crucial for full-length email support aligned with industry standards.
