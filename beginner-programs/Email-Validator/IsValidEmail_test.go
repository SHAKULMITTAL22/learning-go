ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: In its current state, the IsValidEmail function only checks the format of the email without limiting the number of attempts, which makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
Solution: Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed validation attempts.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The regular expression in IsValidEmail function may not cover all valid email formats according to the RFC 5322 standard, potentially leading to false negatives.
Solution: Consider using a more comprehensive regular expression or an external package that fully adheres to the RFC 5322 standard.

Vulnerability: CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
Issue: The email validation does not impose any size limits on the input string aside from a length check, risking potential Denial of Service (DoS) if excessively large inputs are fed into the system.
Solution: Enforce strict input size limits and perform input sanitization before processing the email string.

================================================================================
Having read the contents of the `email.go` file, the function `IsValidEmail` is identified within the `Validator` package. Now, let's proceed with crafting meaningful test scenarios as requested:

---

Scenario 1: Standard Valid Email Test

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithStandardEmail
  Description: This test examines the IsValidEmail function to ensure it correctly identifies valid email addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable with a standard email address (e.g., "user@example.com").
  Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the prepared standard email address as an argument.
  Assert: Use `assert.True(t, result)` to check that the function returns true for the standard email.

Validation:
  Justify: An email formatted as "user@example.com" is universally recognized as valid; therefore, the assertion expects a true result.
  Importance: Asserting standard email format handling is critical for the function's reliability as it's the most common use case.

---

Scenario 2: Invalid Email Test with Missing '@' Symbol

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithoutAtSymbol
  Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function properly handles email strings that lack the '@' symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string variable with an email missing the '@' symbol (e.g., "userexample.com").
  Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function on the invalid email string.
  Assert: Use `assert.False(t, result)` to confirm that the function returns false for the email without '@'.

Validation:
  Justify: The absence of the '@' symbol makes the email format incorrect. Consequently, a false result is the correct expectation.
  Importance: This test ensures that basic structural validation is enforced, which is essential for email address validation.

---

Scenario 3: Invalid Email Test with Excessive Length

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithExcessiveLength
  Description: This test verifies that the IsValidEmail function rejects email addresses exceeding a reasonable length.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a string builder or concatenation to create an email string that is longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Test the IsValidEmail function with the excessively long email address.
  Assert: Perform an `assert.False(t, result)` check to validate that a false result is returned for overly long emails.

Validation:
  Justify: According to the function's implementation, any email address longer than 255 characters should be considered invalid.
  Importance: Preventing unnecessarily long emails is a safeguard against potential security risks or processing issues.

---

Scenario 4: Valid Email with Subdomain

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithSubdomain
  Description: This scenario tests the IsValidEmail function on an email address that includes a subdomain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an email address with a subdomain, such as "user@sub.example.com".
  Act: Call IsValidEmail with this email address.
  Assert: Use `assert.True(t, result)` to confirm that the function correctly returns true for the valid subdomain.

Validation:
  Justify: Emails with subdomains are valid, so the expected result of the function should be true.
  Importance: Covers the use case of subdomains in emails, which is a common occurrence and should be handled properly.

---

Scenario 5: Invalid Email Test with Special Characters in Domain

Details:
  TestName: TestIsValidEmailWithSpecialCharsInDomain
  Description: This test examines how IsValidEmail handles email addresses with invalid special characters in the domain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email address such as "user@example!.com" with unacceptable characters in the domain.
  Act: Employ IsValidEmail to verify the invalid email address format.
  Assert: Utilize `assert.False(t, result)` to ensure the function deems this email as invalid.

Validation:
  Justify: Special characters like '!' are not permitted in the domain part of an email, warranting a false result.
  Importance: Validates that the email format respect domain naming rules, an essential part of email validation.

---

Please note that these tests should be written within the *_test.go file located in the same package as `IsValidEmail` using the `testing` package within Go for execution and the `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` package for concise assertions. Corresponding functions within `*_test.go` should resemble the "Execution" segment of each scenario, and an appropriate instance of the *testing.T object should be passed to the test functions.
