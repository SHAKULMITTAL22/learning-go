Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]

### Scenario 1: Valid Email Format
Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies a properly formatted email address as valid. This includes checking typical email formats like `name@domain.com`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string with a valid email format.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the defined string.
  Assert: Check if the function returns `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function returns `true` for a valid email address, which is crucial for application components relying on valid user contact data. This test ensures that the function behaves as expected when provided with a typical valid email.

### Scenario 2: Email Exceeds Maximum Length
Details:
  Description: This test checks if the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies an email address that exceeds the maximum length (255 characters) as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string that is a valid email format but longer than 255 characters.
  Act: Pass this long email string to the `IsValidEmail` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function can handle and correctly respond to data constraints, preventing database or UI overflow errors. This test is important for maintaining data integrity and user experience.

### Scenario 3: Email with Missing Domain
Details:
  Description: Tests whether the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies an email missing the domain part (e.g., `username@`) as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string representing an email without a domain.
  Act: Invoke the `IsValidEmail` function with this string.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms that the function enforces complete email structures, which is essential for ensuring valid communication channels in user management systems.

### Scenario 4: Email with Invalid Characters
Details:
  Description: This scenario tests if the `IsValidEmail` function identifies emails containing invalid characters (e.g., `name#domain.com`) as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that includes invalid characters in the email.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for robust parsing and validation mechanisms, critical for preventing injection attacks or processing errors. This test helps in fortifying the application's input validation processes.

### Scenario 5: Empty Email String
Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function returns `false` when provided with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty string.
  Act: Pass this empty string to the `IsValidEmail` function.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is `false`.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that the function treats empty input as invalid, which is important for preventing issues related to uninitialized or null values in data processing and storage.

### Scenario 6: Email with Missing '@' Symbol
Details:
  Description: Checks if the `IsValidEmail` function identifies an email string without the '@' symbol as invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string that looks like an email but lacks the '@' symbol.
  Act: Execute the `IsValidEmail` function with this string.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the function checks for critical components of email structure. Ensuring the presence of '@' is fundamental for distinguishing local parts from domain parts in emails, crucial for routing and delivery.

These scenarios collectively ensure that `IsValidEmail` is thoroughly tested against various common and edge cases, maintaining the function's reliability and the system's integrity.
