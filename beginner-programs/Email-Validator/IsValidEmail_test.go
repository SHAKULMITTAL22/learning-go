File: learning-go/beginner-programs/Email-Validator/email_test.go
  Test Cases:
    [TestIsValidEmail]


### Scenario 1: Valid Email with Common Format
Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a standard email format as valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string representing a common email format, e.g., "user@example.com".
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with the arranged email string.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion that the result should be `true` is based on the general acceptance of "user@example.com" as a valid email format. This test is crucial as it ensures that the function correctly handles typical user input which adheres to standard email patterns.

### Scenario 2: Email Exceeding Maximum Length
Details:
  Description: Tests that the function returns `false` for an email string longer than 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string that is 256 characters long, constructed to be syntactically correct but exceeding the length constraint.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the long email string.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the function's explicit check for string length greater than 255 characters. This scenario is important for ensuring the function enforces email length constraints, which could impact database storage or UI rendering.

### Scenario 3: Email with Missing Domain
Details:
  Description: Checks the function's ability to reject an email lacking a domain section.
Execution:
  Arrange: An email string without a domain, e.g., "username@".
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with this incomplete email.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  The email format is incomplete without a domain, making the assertion for `false` logical. This test ensures the function can identify and reject incomplete email inputs, which are common user errors.

### Scenario 4: Email with Special Characters in Local Part
Details:
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly handle valid emails with allowed special characters in the local part.
Execution:
  Arrange: A valid email with special characters, e.g., "user.name+tag@example.com".
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the arranged email.
  Assert: The function should return `true`.
Validation:
  The chosen assertion checks that the function adheres to email specifications allowing certain special characters. This test is vital for ensuring the function's compliance with diverse and valid email formats used in real-world scenarios.

### Scenario 5: Email with Invalid Characters
Details:
  Description: Tests whether the function rejects emails containing characters not allowed in either the local or domain parts.
Execution:
  Arrange: An email containing invalid characters, e.g., "user@exa$mple.com".
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with the invalid email.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion for `false` is based on the presence of '$' which is not allowed in email addresses. This test is important to ensure that the function can safeguard against input errors or potential security risks from improperly formatted emails.

### Scenario 6: Empty String as Email
Details:
  Description: Verifies that the function treats an empty string as an invalid email.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty string.
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the empty string.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Since an empty string does not meet any criteria for a valid email, the assertion of `false` is expected. Testing this scenario ensures that the function handles and rejects empty inputs, preventing possible errors in further processing or storage.

Each scenario above is designed to check different aspects of the `IsValidEmail` function's capability to validate email addresses according to established rules and edge cases, thereby ensuring robustness and reliability in its operation.
