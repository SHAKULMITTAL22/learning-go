ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The email length check is performed after the regular expression match, which could lead to potential ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attacks.
Solution: Perform the length check before the regular expression match to prevent potential ReDoS attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash with a Predictable Salt
Issue: The emailRegexp variable is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, which could lead to potential injection attacks if the regular expression is not properly constructed or contains a predictable salt.
Solution: Ensure that the emailRegexp regular expression is securely constructed and contains a unique, unpredictable salt to prevent injection attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing a valid email address

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a valid email address as such.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a valid email address as the input parameter.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the valid email address.
Assert: Verify that the function returns true.

Validation:
The assertion is appropriate because it checks the core functionality of the function, which is to identify valid email addresses. This test ensures that the function behaves as expected when given a valid email address.

---

Scenario 2: Testing an empty email address

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an empty email address as invalid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up an empty string as the input parameter.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the empty string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion is appropriate because it checks the edge case of an empty email address, ensuring that the function handles it correctly.

---

Scenario 3: Testing a null email address

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles a null email address.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a nil value as the input parameter.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the nil value.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion is appropriate because it checks the error handling of the function when given a null value.

---

Scenario 4: Testing an email address with a single character

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a single-character email address as invalid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a single-character string as the input parameter.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the single-character string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion is appropriate because it checks the edge case of a single-character email address, ensuring that the function handles it correctly.

---

Scenario 5: Testing an email address with a very long local part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an email address with a very long local part as invalid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a string with a very long local part (more than 64 characters) as the input parameter.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long local part string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion is appropriate because it checks the edge case of an email address with a very long local part, ensuring that the function handles it correctly.

---

Scenario 6: Testing an email address with a very long domain part

Details:
Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an email address with a very long domain part as invalid.

Execution:
Arrange: Set up a string with a very long domain part (more than 255 characters) as the input parameter.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the long domain part string.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.

Validation:
The assertion is appropriate because it checks the edge case of an email address with a very long domain part, ensuring that the function handles it correctly.
