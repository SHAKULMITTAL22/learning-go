    TestIsValidEmail
  ]
### Scenario 1: Valid Email Format

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies a properly formatted email address as valid. The test will use a typical email format to ensure the function behaves as expected under normal circumstances.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string variable representing a valid email address, e.g., "user@example.com".
  Act: Call `IsValidEmail` with the prepared email string.
  Assert: Check if the function returns `true`, indicating the email is valid.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for a `true` return value, which is expected for a valid email format. This test is crucial because it ensures that valid emails are not mistakenly rejected, which is fundamental for user registration, communication, and authentication processes.

### Scenario 2: Email Exceeding Length Limit

Details:
  Description: Tests whether the `IsValidEmail` function rejects email addresses that exceed the maximum length limit (255 characters). This test ensures that the function enforces length constraints which could impact storage and processing efficiency.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a string representing an email that is 256 characters long.
  Act: Invoke `IsValidEmail` with this long email string.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion for `false` is essential as it confirms the function's ability to enforce length constraints. Long emails could lead to potential issues in database storage or performance degradation, making this test significant for system stability and integrity.

### Scenario 3: Email with Missing Domain

Details:
  Description: This scenario checks if the `IsValidEmail` function correctly identifies an email string missing the domain part (e.g., "user@") as invalid. It's important for ensuring that the email addresses are complete for successful delivery.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an incomplete email string without a domain.
  Act: Execute `IsValidEmail` with this string.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion for `false` validates that the function can reject incomplete email formats. Ensuring only complete emails are accepted is crucial for the practical usability of email addresses in communications.

### Scenario 4: Email with Invalid Characters

Details:
  Description: Evaluates how `IsValidEmail` handles email addresses containing characters that are typically not allowed. This test ensures robust input validation against potential security risks or data corruption.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an email string with invalid characters, such as "user!#%&*@example.com".
  Act: Use `IsValidEmail` to assess the validity of this email.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  The `false` assertion is critical as it confirms that the function properly handles unusual or prohibited characters, enhancing security by preventing potential injection attacks or data handling anomalies.

### Scenario 5: Valid Email with Subdomains

Details:
  Description: Tests if `IsValidEmail` can correctly validate emails that include subdomains, which is common in organizational email addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid email string with subdomains, such as "user@mail.subdomain.example.com".
  Act: Test the email string using `IsValidEmail`.
  Assert: The function should return `true`, indicating the email is valid.
Validation:
  Asserting `true` checks the function's capability to handle complex but valid email structures. This is important for applications dealing with diverse email formats, ensuring broad compatibility and user inclusivity.
