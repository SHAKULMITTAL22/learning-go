================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'IsValidEmail' does not properly validate the input email string, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by sending an email string longer than 255 characters.
Solution: Add input validation before checking the email format to ensure the string length does not exceed the limit. For example: 'if len(email) > 255 ||!emailRegexp.MatchString(email) { return false }'.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The 'regexp' package used for email validation might not be secure enough, as it may not cover all possible valid email formats and could potentially be exploited by an attacker sending a specially crafted email string.
Solution: Consider using a more robust and secure email validation library, such as 'github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation' or 'github.com/asaskevich/govalidator', which have been thoroughly tested and are widely used in the Go community.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid email address within length limit

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies a valid email address as such, given that the email address is within the length limit.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address that is within the length limit and is a valid email format (<user>@<domain>.<tld>).
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the IsValidEmail function when provided with a valid email address. The test validates the function's ability to correctly identify valid email addresses.

Scenario 2: Email address length exceeding the limit

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address as invalid when its length exceeds the limit.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with a length greater than 255 characters.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the IsValidEmail function when provided with an email address that exceeds the length limit. The test validates the function's ability to correctly handle edge cases related to the length of the email address.

Scenario 3: Invalid email format within length limit

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an invalid email address as such, given that the email address is within the length limit.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address that is within the length limit but in an invalid format (<user>@<domain>.<tld>).
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the IsValidEmail function when provided with an invalid email address format. The test validates the function's ability to correctly handle invalid email formats within the length limit.

Scenario 4: Empty email address string

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an empty email address string as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an empty email address string.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address string as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the IsValidEmail function when provided with an empty email address string. The test validates the function's ability to correctly handle empty strings.

Scenario 5: Email address with leading or trailing whitespaces

Details:
Description: This test checks if the IsValidEmail function correctly identifies an email address with leading or trailing whitespaces as invalid.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up an email address with leading or trailing whitespaces.
Act: Invoke the IsValidEmail function with the email address as the parameter.
Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the IsValidEmail function when provided with an email address with leading or trailing whitespaces. The test validates the function's ability to correctly handle email addresses with leading or trailing whitespaces.
