Here are the existing test scenarios for the function, which are not considered while generating test cases 
undefined:
  [
    TestIsValidEmail
  ]### Scenario 1: Valid Email Format
Details:
  Description: Test to verify that the `IsValidEmail` function returns true for a properly formatted email address.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string variable with a valid email address format.
  Act: Invoke the `IsValidEmail` function with the valid email string.
  Assert: Check that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks whether the function correctly identifies a valid email format. Ensuring the function handles standard email formats correctly is fundamental, as email validation is a common requirement in user input validation across applications.

### Scenario 2: Email Exceeding Maximum Length
Details:
  Description: Test to ensure that the `IsValidEmail` function returns false when the email string exceeds 255 characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string variable that is 256 characters long and structured like an email.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with this long email string.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to enforce maximum email length constraints. It is crucial for preventing potential buffer overflow errors or database storage issues, aligning with typical email length limits in most systems.

### Scenario 3: Email with Missing '@' Character
Details:
  Description: Check that the `IsValidEmail` function returns false for an email address missing the '@' character.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string that resembles an email but without the '@' symbol.
  Act: Invoke the `IsValidEmail` function with this string.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the function can identify and reject emails missing essential components. This test is important for basic email format validation, ensuring that only correctly formatted emails are accepted.

### Scenario 4: Email with Multiple '@' Characters
Details:
  Description: Ensure that the `IsValidEmail` function returns false for an email address containing more than one '@' character.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a string with more than one '@' character formatted as an email.
  Act: Use the `IsValidEmail` function on this string.
  Assert: Check that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles cases where the email format is corrupted by multiple '@' symbols. It's crucial for maintaining the integrity of email parsing and storage processes.

### Scenario 5: Empty Email String
Details:
  Description: Test to verify that the `IsValidEmail` function returns false when provided with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty string variable.
  Act: Call the `IsValidEmail` function with the empty string.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the function's ability to handle empty input. This scenario is vital for guarding against unintended behavior in cases where user input might be missing.

### Scenario 6: Email with Invalid Characters
Details:
  Description: Test that the `IsValidEmail` function returns false when the email contains characters not typically allowed in emails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a string with invalid characters (e.g., emojis or special symbols) structured as an email.
  Act: Invoke the `IsValidEmail` function with this string.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns false.
Validation:
  This test is important for verifying that the function can filter out emails with invalid characters, ensuring compliance with email standards and preventing potential issues in email processing or display.

Each of these scenarios helps ensure that the `IsValidEmail` function operates correctly across various typical and edge cases, covering both normal operations and potential error conditions. This comprehensive testing approach is essential for maintaining robust validation logic in the application.
