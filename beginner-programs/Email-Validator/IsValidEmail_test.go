ROOST_METHOD_HASH=IsValidEmail_9ebd397bff
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=IsValidEmail_d2603fb18f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'IsValidEmail' does not check for a valid email format, allowing potential attackers to bypass the email validation check.
Solution: Use a well-tested email validation library like 'go-validator' or 'validator.v9' to ensure proper email format checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Insecure Transport Layer Security Protocol
Issue: The code does not explicitly enforce the use of HTTPS, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
Solution: Enforce HTTPS connections by using the 'http.ServeTLS' function and ensuring proper certificate validation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check if a valid email address is considered valid

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a valid email address as valid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a valid email address, e.g., "test@example.com".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the defined email address as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: The IsValidEmail function should return true for valid email addresses.
    Discuss the importance of the test: It is crucial to ensure that valid email addresses are correctly identified, as this function is responsible for validating user input.

  Scenario 2: Check if an empty string is considered invalid

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies an empty string as an invalid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define an empty string, e.g., "".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the defined empty string as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: An empty string should not be considered a valid email address.
    Discuss the importance of the test: It is essential to handle edge cases, such as an empty string, to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.

  Scenario 3: Check if a string longer than 255 characters is considered invalid

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a string longer than 255 characters as an invalid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a string longer than 255 characters, e.g., "verylongemail@verylongdomainname.com".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the defined long string as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: A string longer than 255 characters should not be considered a valid email address, as it violates the maximum length requirement.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Ensuring the correctness of the function's behavior when handling strings longer than the allowed limit is essential to prevent unexpected results and potential security vulnerabilities.

  Scenario 4: Check if a string without an "@" symbol is considered invalid

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a string without an "@" symbol as an invalid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a string without an "@" symbol, e.g., "testexample.com".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the defined string as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: A string without an "@" symbol should not be considered a valid email address, as it violates the email address format.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Ensuring the correctness of the function's behavior when handling strings with an incorrect format is essential to prevent unexpected results and potential security vulnerabilities.

  Scenario 5: Check if a string with multiple "@" symbols is considered invalid

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a string with multiple "@" symbols as an invalid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a string with multiple "@" symbols, e.g., "test@example@com".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the defined string as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: A string with multiple "@" symbols should not be considered a valid email address, as it violates the email address format.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Ensuring the correctness of the function's behavior when handling strings with an incorrect format is essential to prevent unexpected results and potential security vulnerabilities.

  Scenario 6: Check if a string with a domain longer than 63 characters is considered invalid

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a string with a domain longer than 63 characters as an invalid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a string with a domain longer than 63 characters, e.g., "test@example123456789012345678901234567890.com".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the defined string as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: A string with a domain longer than 63 characters should not be considered a valid email address, as it violates the domain length requirement.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Ensuring the correctness of the function's behavior when handling strings with domains longer than the allowed limit is essential to prevent unexpected results and potential security vulnerabilities.

  Scenario 7: Check if a string with a top-level domain longer than 6 characters is considered invalid

  Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a string with a top-level domain longer than 6 characters as an invalid email address.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a string with a top-level domain longer than 6 characters, e.g., "test@example.commmmm".
    Act: Call the IsValidEmail function with the defined string as a parameter.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion: A string with a top-level domain longer than 6 characters should not be considered a valid email address, as it violates the top-level domain length requirement.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Ensuring the correctness of the function's behavior when handling strings with top-level domains longer than the allowed limit is essential to prevent unexpected results and potential security vulnerabilities.
