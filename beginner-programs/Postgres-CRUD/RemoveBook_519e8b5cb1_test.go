/*
1. Successfully Remove a Book: This scenario will test if the function successfully deletes a book record from the database. Provide a valid book ID which exists in the database, and the function should delete the record and return the number of records deleted (which in this case, should be 1).

2. Remove Non-existing Book: Provide a book ID which does not exist in the database. The function should be able to handle this without errors and return 0, indicating no record was deleted.

3. Negative Book ID: Test the function with providing a negative book ID. The behavior here might depend on whether the database allows negative IDs for books or not. If it does, then it should treat it as a valid ID and proceed with attempted deletion. If not, we expect the function to handle this case gracefully, signaling an appropriate error.

4. Delete with Closed DB Connection: Test the function when the DB connection is closed. The function should return an error indicating it can't connect to the DB.

5. Large Book ID: Provide a large book ID that is outside the range of an integer type or is greater than any existing book ID. The function should handle this situation appropriately and return an error or indication that no rows were affected.

6. Book ID as Zero: Provide zero as input for the book ID, the function should handle this gracefully, and in this case, the function should not delete anything, since there are no books with ID 0.

7. SQL Injection test: Provide a book ID that attempts SQL injection like "0 or 1=1--". The function should treat the input as a string and return an error.

8. Execution Time: Test the function with deleting a known book ID and record the execution time. This helps measure the performance of the delete operation.

9. Concurrently deleting the same book record: Run two or more tests simultaneously which try to delete the same book. One should succeed and the others should fail gracefully or show that no rows were affected.
