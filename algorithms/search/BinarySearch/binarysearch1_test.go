```
Scenario 1: Query Element is Present in Array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if `binarySearch1` correctly identifies the index of an element that is present in a sorted array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An array like `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` and a query `5`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return `2`.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that when a query matches an element, the function returns the correct index. This is fundamental to ensure the binary search is operating correctly in standard conditions.

Scenario 2: Query Element is Not Present in Array

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that `binarySearch1` returns `-1` when the element is not present in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An array like `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` and a query `5`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return `-1`.
  Validation:
    Asserting `-1` ensures the function can identify when an item is absent, which is crucial for correctly indicating missing elements.

Scenario 3: Query is Below Range of Array Elements

Details:
  Description: This test verifies behavior when the query is less than the smallest element in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An array like `[2, 3, 4, 5]` and a query `1`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return `-1`.
  Validation:
    This checks proper handling of boundary conditions when the query is less than all array elements, ensuring correct handling of minimum bounds.

Scenario 4: Query is Above Range of Array Elements

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function reacts if the query is greater than the largest element in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An array like `[3, 4, 5, 6]` and a query `10`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return `-1`.
  Validation:
    Similar to lower bounds, this scenario tests handling of conditions where the query exceeds all elements, which is necessary for understanding error handling and correctness.

Scenario 5: Empty Array

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of `binarySearch1` when the array is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An empty array `[]` and any query, such as `3`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return `-1`.
  Validation:
    Testing with an empty array ensures that the function can do a sanity check for input validation and does not perform out-of-bound operations.

Scenario 6: Single Element Array - Element Present

Details:
  Description: This test investigates the scenario where the array has only one element, which matches the query.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An array with one element `[7]` and a query `7`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return `0`.
  Validation:
    Ensures even the smallest possible valid array can be correctly handled, which is pivotal for completeness.

Scenario 7: Single Element Array - Element Absent

Details:
  Description: This test investigates how the function handles a single-element array where the query doesn't match.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An array with one element `[8]` and a query `10`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return `-1`.
  Validation:
    This verifies boundary cases indicating the function performs correctly when only one element is present and not matching.

Scenario 8: Middle Element is the Target

Details:
  Description: This test checks how `binarySearch1` reacts when the middle element is the one queried.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An array `[4, 6, 8, 10, 12]` and a query `8`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return `2`.
  Validation:
    Verifies that the mid-point calculation is correct and can immediately return the index when the middle is the target.

Scenario 9: Handling Duplicates - Query Matching Multiple

Details:
  Description: Checks behavior when the target exists in multiple positions, though this binary search isnâ€™t meant for duplicates, it helps ascertain the first found return.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]` and a query `3`.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Expect the function to return any valid index of `3`.
  Validation:
    Though ideally, binary search is not optimized for duplicates, ensuring no incorrect index or errors assures robustness.

Scenario 10: Larger Array

Details:
  Description: To test `binarySearch1` on a larger array size, verifying performance and correctness.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A large, sorted array of a few hundred elements, choosing a specific query.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch1` function with these parameters.
    Assert: Verify the correct index or `-1` as expected.
  Validation:
    Ensure efficient handling across large datasets, vital for applications relying on extensive data processing.
