Scenario 1: Searching an existing element in the middle of the array

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to find an element that exists in the middle of the sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers containing multiple elements. Select a value present in the middle of the array.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` with the array and the selected middle value.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct index of the selected element.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the function's correctness in typical conditions, where the element resides at an expected position, testing core functionality.

Scenario 2: Searching an element not present in the array

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's performance when a queried element does not exist in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers that does not include the query element.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` with the array and a value not present in the array.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns -1 to indicate the absence of the element.
Validation:
  This demonstrates the function's error-handling capability when the search is unsuccessful, ensuring robustness.

Scenario 3: Searching an element at the beginning of the array

Details:
  Description: This test examines the function's ability to locate the first element in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sorted array of integers. Choose the first element as the query.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` using the array and the initial element.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns index 0.
Validation:
  Verifies correct behavior for an edge case where the queried element is at the array's start.

Scenario 4: Searching an element at the end of the array

Details:
  Description: This scenario checks if the function can successfully find the last element in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an array with several elements. Select the last element as the query.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` with the array and last element.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned index equals the last index of the array.
Validation:
  Confirms function accuracy in handling edge cases at the array's termination.

Scenario 5: Searching in an empty array

Details:
  Description: Tests the function when given an empty array as input to ensure it handles this edge case gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Utilize an empty array as input.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` with the empty array and any integer query.
  Assert: Validate that the function returns -1.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can properly manage cases with no possible matches, proving its stability in minimal input conditions.

Scenario 6: Searching an element in a single-element array where the element is present

Details:
  Description: This scenario checks how the function reacts when the array contains only one element, which matches the query.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a single-element array with a value matching the query.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` with the single-element array and matching query.
  Assert: Verify a return index of 0.
Validation:
  Evaluates correct behavior in a base case with simplest search requirements.

Scenario 7: Searching an element in a single-element array where the element is absent

Details:
  Description: Tests how the function behaves when querying a single-element array with a non-matching target.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a single-element array with a non-matching query.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` with the query not present in the array.
  Assert: Check that -1 is returned.
Validation:
  Confirms the functionâ€™s handling of another minimal input case, demonstrating robust absence detection.

Scenario 8: Searching in an array with duplicate elements

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to find any occurrence of a queried element when duplicates are allowed in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Form an array with repeated integers and include the desired query multiple times.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` with the array and the repeated query value.
  Assert: Assert that the function returns a valid index corresponding to one of the query's occurrences.
Validation:
  Evaluates consistency in returning valid indices even when duplicates exist, confirming logical soundness.

Scenario 9: Searching in a reverse-sorted array

Details:
  Description: Verifies the function's incorrect results in an array not sorted in ascending order, as binary search assumes array sortedness.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a reverse-sorted array and a query value that should exist in an ascending-sorted version.
  Act: Call `binarySearch1` with the reverse-sorted input.
  Assert: Verify that -1 is returned, as the input violates function assumptions.
Validation:
  Demonstrates the necessity for precondition adherence, ensuring input validity in operational contexts.
```

These scenarios aim to exhaustively explore the function's behavior under various conditions, validating its efficacy and robustness within expected and edge case scenarios.
