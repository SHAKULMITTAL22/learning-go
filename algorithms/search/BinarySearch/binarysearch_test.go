Below are some test scenarios designed for the `binarySearch` function, following the provided format:

---

Scenario 1: Search for an Element Present in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies the position of a query element that is present in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a sorted array and choose an element known to be in the array as the query.
    Act: Call the `binarySearch` function with the array and the query.
    Assert: Expect the function to return the actual index of the query element in the array.
  Validation:
    The assertion is based on the property of binary search to locate the position of an element. This test is essential as it checks the primary functionality of searching within the array.

---

Scenario 2: Search for an Element Not Present in the Array

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function properly returns -1 when the query element is not present in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a sorted array and select a query element not present in the array.
    Act: Invoke `binarySearch` with the array and missing element.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns -1.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that missing elements are handled correctly, which is crucial for robust search feature expectations.

---

Scenario 3: Search in an Empty Array

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function behaves correctly when the input array is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an empty array and any integer as the query.
    Act: Execute the `binarySearch` using the empty array.
    Assert: Confirm that the function correctly returns -1.
  Validation:
    This ensures that behavior in edge cases, like an empty dataset, remains consistent and predictable.

---

Scenario 4: Search for the First Element

Details:
  Description: Test the functionâ€™s ability to locate the first element of the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a sorted array and use the first element as the query.
    Act: Pass the array and the first element to `binarySearch`.
    Assert: Expect the function to return 0, the index of the first element.
  Validation:
    Ensures that boundary case of searching for the first element is captured accurately, vital for full coverage of positional searches.

---

Scenario 5: Search for the Last Element

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can find the last element in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Construct a sorted array with the last element as the query.
    Act: Pass this array and the query to `binarySearch`.
    Assert: Confirm whether the function returns the index of the last element.
  Validation:
    This checks the end-boundary condition to ascertain that searches near the end of the data set are handled effectively.

---

Scenario 6: Search for an Element in a Two-Element Array

Details:
  Description: Evaluate whether the function correctly identifies elements in a small array of two elements.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use a two-element, sorted array and choose either element as the query.
    Act: Execute `binarySearch` with the array and chosen element.
    Assert: Validate the function returns the correct index, either 0 or 1.
  Validation:
    Necessary to ensure robustness in minimal input case scenarios where array size is at a minimum.

---

Scenario 7: Search for an Element Not Present in a Two-Element Array

Details:
  Description: Test the function's response to a missing query in a two-element array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a two-element, sorted array and a non-existent query.
    Act: Run `binarySearch` with the array and the nonexistent element.
    Assert: Check the function returns -1.
  Validation:
    Demonstrates the handling of edge cases, ensuring unavailability is captured even in constrained datasets.

---

These scenarios cover a variety of common use cases and edge conditions to test the `binarySearch` function's robustness. They are structured to ensure the function behaves as expected across typical and extreme situations.
