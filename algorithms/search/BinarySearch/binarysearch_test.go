Here's a set of test scenarios for the `binarySearch` function, each addressing various situations where the binary search algorithm is used:

### Scenario 1: Query Exists in Array

  **Details:**
  - Description: Testing when the query number exists in the array and is located in the middle of the array.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare a sorted array of integers and select a number that is in the middle of the array.
  - Act: Call the `binarySearch` function with the array and the middle number as the query.
  - Assert: Validate that the returned index from the function corresponds to the index of the query in the array.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Assertion: Use `assert.Equal` to compare the returned index with the expected index.
  - Importance: It ensures that the function correctly identifies when a search target resides at the typical midpoint of the array.

### Scenario 2: Query at the Last Position

  **Details:**
  - Description: Testing when the query is the last element of the array.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers, and select the last integer as the query.
  - Act: Pass the array and the last integer to the `binarySearch` function.
  - Assert: Check that the returned index matches the end of the array.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Assertion: Use `assert.Equal` to verify the returned index is the last index of the array.
  - Importance: This scenario confirms the flexibility of the algorithm to handle queries at the boundary condition of the last position.

### Scenario 3: Query at the First Position

  **Details:**
  - Description: Testing when the query is the first element in the array.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare a sorted array, and select the first element as the query.
  - Act: Invoke the `binarySearch` with the array and the first element.
  - Assert: Validate that the index returned is zero.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Assertion: Use `assert.Equal` to compare the returned index with zero.
  - Importance: Ensures that `binarySearch` works correctly when the query is located at the very start of the array.

### Scenario 4: Query Does Not Exist

  **Details:**
  - Description: Testing when the query integer does not exist in the array.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Prepare a sorted array and a query integer that is outside the range of the array elements.
  - Act: Call `binarySearch` with this array and the non-existent query.
  - Assert: Check that the function returns -1.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Assertion: Use `assert.Equal` with -1 as the expected output.
  - Importance: Critical to ensure that the function can correctly identify when an item is not present in the array.

### Scenario 5: Empty Array

  **Details:**
  - Description: Testing the behavior when the input array is empty.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Define an empty array of integers.
  - Act: Execute the `binarySearch` function with the empty array and any integer query.
  - Assert: Ensure the function returns -1.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Assertion: Use `assert.Equal` to expect -1.
  - Importance: Validates function robustness to handle empty input gracefully.

### Scenario 6: Single Element Matching Query

  **Details:**
  - Description: Testing with an array that contains only one element which matches the query.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Create a one-element array where the element is the query.
  - Act: Use `binarySearch` with this array and the matching query.
  - Assert: Confirm the function returns index 0.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Assertion: Use `assert.Equal` to check for index 0.
  - Importance: Assures that a single-element array is correctly evaluated when containing the query.

### Scenario 7: Single Element Not Matching Query

  **Details:**
  - Description: Testing with an array of a single element that does not match the query.
  
  **Execution:**
  - Arrange: Compose an array with just one element different from the query.
  - Act: Call the function with this array and a non-matching query.
  - Assert: Verify that the return value is -1.
  
  **Validation:**
  - Assertion: Use `assert.Equal` to validate an output of -1.
  - Importance: Confirms the function's ability to handle simple cases where the single element does not meet the search criterion.

These scenarios provide a comprehensive coverage of both typical and edge cases for the `binarySearch` function, validating its correctness across a range of practical and boundary conditions.
