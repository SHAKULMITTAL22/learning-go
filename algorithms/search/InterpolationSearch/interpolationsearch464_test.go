Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/search/InterpolationSearch/interpolationsearch_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestInterpolationSearch]

Given the `interpolationSearch` function, here's a series of test scenarios designed to evaluate its functionality thoroughly, including normal operations and edge cases:

---

Scenario 1: Search for an element in a sorted array that exists.

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies the index of an existing element within a sorted array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers and select an existing element for searching.
    Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the array and the element.
    Assert: Check that the returned index corresponds to the location of the element in the array.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that if the element is in the array, its index is correctly found. This is crucial in confirming the primary functionality of the search algorithm.

---

Scenario 2: Search for an element in a sorted array that does not exist.

Details:
  Description: Test that the function returns -1 when the queried element isn't in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a sorted array and select a number not present in the array.
    Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the array and the non-existent element.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns -1.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the function can correctly determine when an element isn't present in the array, which is important for its reliability.

---

Scenario 3: Search in an empty array.

Details:
  Description: Confirm the function handles an empty array input gracefully.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use an empty array and any integer as the query.
    Act: Call the `interpolationSearch` function with the empty array and the integer.
    Assert: Ensure the function returns -1.
  Validation:
    The test checks that the function doesn't crash or misbehave with an empty input, maintaining robust input handling.

---

Scenario 4: Search in an array with identical elements where the element is present.

Details:
  Description: Validate the function's behavior in an array composed entirely of the same value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an array with all elements being the same and set the query to this common value.
    Act: Call the function with the array and the query value.
    Assert: Confirm that the function returns any valid index of the searched element.
  Validation:
    Consistent results in scenarios with homogeneous arrays indicate proper index calculations without division errors.

---

Scenario 5: Search in an array with a single element that matches the search query.

Details:
  Description: Check the function's response when the array has only one element which is the query value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an array with a single element and use it as the query.
    Act: Call `interpolationSearch` with this single-element array.
    Assert: Verify the function returns index 0, the position of the element.
  Validation:
    Ensures correct behavior in minimal input size scenarios, which could uncover off-by-one errors.

---

Scenario 6: Search in an array where the query is larger than any element.

Details:
  Description: Assess the function's ability to identify an out-of-bounds query beyond the array's range.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a sorted array and use a query greater than the largest element.
    Act: Perform the search using the `interpolationSearch` function.
    Assert: Check that the result is -1, as the query is outside the array's range.
  Validation:
    This scenario validates the function's handling of queries larger than any array element, ensuring upper bound checks are effective.

---

Scenario 7: Search in an array where the query is smaller than any element.

Details:
  Description: Determine the function's behavior with a query less than the smallest element in the array.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a sorted array and set a query less than the smallest array element.
    Act: Call the function using this setup.
    Assert: Confirm the return value is -1, indicating no match is found.
  Validation:
    Tests the function's lower bound safeguard to ensure correct results for queries smaller than the smallest element.

---

These scenarios are carefully crafted to evaluate the interpolation search function comprehensively, considering not only normal use cases but also edge conditions and abnormal inputs. They confirm the function's correctness, error handling, and general robustness essential for its expected operation in production environments.
