Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/search/JumpSearch/jumpsearch_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestJumpSearch]

Here are the test scenarios for the `jumpSearch` function, considering various edge cases and typical use cases:

---

Scenario 1: Search for an Element in a Small Array

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can successfully find an element in a small, sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a small sorted array with a known element (e.g., [1, 3, 5, 7]) and set the query to a value that exists in the array (e.g., 5).
  Act: Invoke the `jumpSearch` function with the array and the query.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct index of the element.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and logic: Use an equality check to confirm the returned index matches the expected index. This test checks that the function works correctly with small datasets, ensuring basic functionality.

---

Scenario 2: Search for an Element at the Start of the Array

Details:
  Description: Confirm the function can find an element located at the beginning of the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an array where the first element is the query (e.g., [2, 4, 6, 8]), and set the query to the first element (e.g., 2).
  Act: Execute the `jumpSearch` function with the specified array and query.
  Assert: Ensure that the returned index is 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and logic: An assertion for the first index validates the functionâ€™s handling of edge cases where the query is in the initial position, ensuring performance and correctness.

---

Scenario 3: Element Not Present in the Array

Details:
  Description: Assess the function's ability to return -1 when the queried element is not in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an array with elements that do not include the query (e.g., [1, 4, 6, 9]) and set the query to a value not in the array (e.g., 3).
  Act: Call the `jumpSearch` function using the setup.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is -1, indicating the element was not found.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and logic: An assertion that the result is -1 tests the function's error handling, ensuring it properly reports non-existent elements.

---

Scenario 4: Search for an Element in a Large Array

Details:
  Description: Test the function's efficiency and correctness with a large array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct a large sorted array with thousands of elements and choose a query that exists within the array.
  Act: Use the `jumpSearch` function to search for the element.
  Assert: Verify the index of the queried element is correct.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and logic: Ensure that the function scales well and is efficient with larger datasets, crucial for performance testing and real-world application.

---

Scenario 5: Search in an Array with Duplicate Elements

Details:
  Description: Ensure correct operation when the array contains duplicate elements, and the query matches one of these.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with duplicate numbers (e.g., [1, 3, 5, 5, 7]) and set the query to one of the duplicates (e.g., 5).
  Act: Invoke the `jumpSearch` function.
  Assert: Check that the index of one occurrence of the element is returned.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and logic: Return one of the indexes of the duplicate ensures robustness and confirms behavior in typical datasets involving duplicates.

---

Scenario 6: Empty Array Check

Details:
  Description: Validate function response to an empty array, ensuring correct handling without raising errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty array and any integer as the query.
  Act: Call the `jumpSearch` with the empty array.
  Assert: Ensure the result is -1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and logic: Confirming a return of -1 confirms proper error handling for empty datasets, ensuring no runtime errors or panics.

---

Scenario 7: Element at the End of the Array

Details:
  Description: Confirm that the element is accurately located when positioned at the last index of the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an array with the query as the last element (e.g., [1, 3, 5, 9, 11]) and set the query to the last item (e.g., 11).
  Act: Use `jumpSearch` to perform the search.
  Assert: Validate that the returned index corresponds to the last element.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and logic: Ensuring the correct index for the tail scenario confirms thorough edge case handling within the function.

These scenarios cover various edge and typical use cases for `jumpSearch`, ensuring that the function behaves as expected across a range of inputs.
