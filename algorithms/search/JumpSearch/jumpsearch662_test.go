File: learning-go/algorithms/search/JumpSearch/jumpsearch_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestJumpSearch]


Below are test scenarios for the `jumpSearch` function. These tests are designed to cover different cases to ensure the function behaves as expected.

```plaintext
Scenario 1: Search Element Exists at Beginning

Details:
  Description: This test aims to check the functionality when the search query is at the beginning of the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an ordered array [3, 5, 7, 9, 11] and a query element 3.
  Act: Invoke the jumpSearch function with the array and query element.
  Assert: Verify the function returns index 0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies the first index when the search element is the first element. This is crucial for efficiency, ensuring no unnecessary jumps are made.

Scenario 2: Search Element Exists in Middle

Details:
  Description: Validates the function with a typical case where the query element is located in the middle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an ordered array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] and a query element 6.
  Act: Call jumpSearch with the array and query.
  Assert: Assert that the returned index is 2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that elements in the middle of the array are correctly found, important for arrays of any size and distribution.

Scenario 3: Search Element Exists at End

Details:
  Description: Checks the function’s ability to detect an element at the end of the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an ordered array [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] with a query element 9.
  Act: Execute the jumpSearch function with these parameters.
  Assert: Confirm it returns index 4.
Validation:
  Verifies function capabilities to search and return the last element’s index, demonstrating complete array traversal.

Scenario 4: Search Element Not Present

Details:
  Description: Tests behavior when the search element doesn’t exist in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an ordered array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with a non-existent query element 6.
  Act: Use jumpSearch to search for the element.
  Assert: Check that the result is -1.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function should return -1 if the element is not present, ensuring correct error handling.

Scenario 5: Empty Array

Details:
  Description: Examines how the function responds to empty input arrays.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty array [] and any query element 10.
  Act: Call jumpSearch with the array and query.
  Assert: Assert the return value is -1.
Validation:
  Ensures the method handles edge cases gracefully where input arrays have no elements, maintaining robustness.

Scenario 6: Single Element Matching

Details:
  Description: Evaluates the scenario when the array contains only one element, which matches the query.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array [7] with a query element 7.
  Act: Execute jumpSearch with the single-element array and query.
  Assert: Validate it returns index 0.
Validation:
  Confirms functionality for minimal input sizes, ensuring the function operates correctly on small datasets.

Scenario 7: Single Element Non-Matching

Details:
  Description: Checks functionality when a single element array doesn’t match the query.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array [5], and query element 8.
  Act: Call jumpSearch with these values.
  Assert: Ensure the result is -1.
Validation:
  Important for verifying that single entries are properly compared rather than assumed to match when they do not.

Scenario 8: Large Array with Element Present

Details:
  Description: Tests efficiency and correctness on large data sets with the search query present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a large ordered array of integers from 1 to 10000, query element 4567.
  Act: Run jumpSearch with the array and query.
  Assert: Verify the correct index, 4566, is returned.
Validation:
  Demonstrates scalability and performance on large inputs, critical for real-world applications with substantial data.

Scenario 9: Large Array with Element Absent

Details:
  Description: Evaluates performance on large data sets when the search query is absent.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a large ordered array from 1 to 10000, query element 10001.
  Act: Implement jumpSearch on this setup.
  Assert: Confirm it results in -1.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function performs as expected under high load with non-existent elements, validating negative searches on large-scale inputs.
```

These test scenarios cover normal operations, edge cases, and error handling for the `jumpSearch` function, ensuring comprehensive validation across various conditions.
