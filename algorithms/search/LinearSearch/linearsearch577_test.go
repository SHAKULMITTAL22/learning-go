```markdown
Scenario 1: Test linearSearch with a Non-Existent Element

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the `linearSearch` function correctly returns `-1` when the target element is not present in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with a set of integer values that do not include the queried element.
  Act: Call `linearSearch` with the array and an integer that is not in the array.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is `-1`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result. 
  Since the function should return `-1` when the element is not found, the test confirms that the search correctly identifies the absence of the element.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  Ensures that the function handles cases where the element is missing, which is crucial for reliable search operations in applications.

Scenario 2: Test linearSearch with an Empty Array

Details:
  Description: Validate that `linearSearch` handles an empty array input by returning `-1` for any query.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define an empty array.
  Act: Call `linearSearch` with the empty array and any integer query.
  Assert: Check that the result is `-1`.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  An empty array should always return `-1` because searching it can never yield a valid index.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  Verifies robustness when handling edge cases such as empty input.

Scenario 3: Test linearSearch with Multiple Identical Elements

Details:
  Description: Check if the `linearSearch` function returns the index of the first occurrence when there are multiple identical elements in the array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array containing multiple identical elements, interspersed with distinct ones.
  Act: Use `linearSearch` to look for the repeated element.
  Assert: Confirm that the result equals the index of the first occurrence of the query.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  By definition, a linear search should return the index of the first match; confirming this behavior is necessary for predictable outcomes.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  Validates that the function performs correctly with duplications, ensuring consistent search behavior.

Scenario 4: Test linearSearch with Sorted Array

Details:
  Description: Ensure that `linearSearch` correctly finds a target element in a sorted array, demonstrating that sorting does not affect its ability to identify indices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a sorted array of integers.
  Act: Execute `linearSearch` for an element known to be in the array.
  Assert: Verify the result is the correct index of the element.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  Whether the array is sorted or not, the linear search should work correctly, confirming its functionality is unaffected by order.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  Helps reassure that search functionality is reliable and independent of data ordering, complementing sorted data scenarios found in practice.

Scenario 5: Test linearSearch with Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: Assess if `linearSearch` processes arrays containing negative numbers properly, returning the correct index of a negative target.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an array including both negative and positive integers.
  Act: Use `linearSearch` to find a specified negative number in the array.
  Assert: Ensure the returning index matches the position of the negative element.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result.
  The function's ability to handle negative numbers correctly extends its usefulness across a wider range of numeric data.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements.
  Confirms that the function does not mistakenly ignore or misinterpret negative values, which is vital for accurate data handling across potentially mixed datasets.
