Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/sorting/CountingSort/countingsort_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestSelectionSort]

Based on the provided function `countingSort` and the given instructions, here are several test scenarios for the function:

```
Scenario 1: Sort an array with positive integers

Details:
  Description: Test the basic functionality of countingSort with an array containing only positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an unsorted array of positive integers.
  Act: Call countingSort with the prepared array.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is sorted in ascending order.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly sorts a basic array of positive integers, which is the core functionality of the sorting algorithm.

Scenario 2: Sort an array with duplicate elements

Details:
  Description: Verify that countingSort correctly handles arrays with duplicate elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with multiple occurrences of the same integer.
  Act: Pass the array to countingSort.
  Assert: Check that the returned array is sorted and contains all duplicates in the correct order.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the counting sort algorithm correctly handles duplicate values, which is a common scenario in real-world data.

Scenario 3: Sort an array with a single element

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior of countingSort when given an array with only one element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with a single integer.
  Act: Call countingSort with this array.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is identical to the input array.
Validation:
  This edge case test ensures that the function works correctly for minimal input, which is important for robustness.

Scenario 4: Sort an empty array

Details:
  Description: Verify that countingSort handles an empty array input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty integer array.
  Act: Pass the empty array to countingSort.
  Assert: Check that the function returns an empty array.
Validation:
  Testing with an empty array is crucial to ensure the function doesn't crash or produce unexpected results with minimal input.

Scenario 5: Sort an array with all elements being zero

Details:
  Description: Test countingSort's behavior when all elements in the input array are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array filled with zeros.
  Act: Call countingSort with this array.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is identical to the input array.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function handles a special case where all elements are the same and the minimum possible value (assuming non-negative integers).

Scenario 6: Sort an array with large range of values

Details:
  Description: Verify that countingSort can handle arrays with a large range between the minimum and maximum values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with integers ranging from 0 to a very large number (e.g., 1,000,000).
  Act: Pass this array to countingSort.
  Assert: Check that the returned array is correctly sorted.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle inputs with a large range of values, which is important for performance and memory usage considerations.

Scenario 7: Sort an array with negative numbers (error handling)

Details:
  Description: Test how countingSort handles an array containing negative numbers, which it's not designed to sort.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an array that includes negative integers.
  Act: Attempt to call countingSort with this array.
  Assert: Verify that the function either returns an error or panics, as it's not designed to handle negative numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important for error handling, ensuring the function behaves predictably when given invalid input.
```

These test scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and error handling for the `countingSort` function. They aim to thoroughly validate the function's behavior under various conditions.
