ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getCountArrayLength_93c7685300

Based on the provided function `getCountArrayLength`, here are several test scenarios:

```
Scenario 1: Empty Array Input

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior when given an empty array as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty integer slice.
  Act: Call getCountArrayLength with the empty slice.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the edge case of an empty array correctly. The expected result of 1 aligns with the function's logic to return 1 for empty arrays, which is crucial for preventing errors in subsequent operations that might use this result.

Scenario 2: Array with Single Element

Details:
  Description: Test the function with an array containing only one element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with a single integer element.
  Act: Call getCountArrayLength with this single-element slice.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the element's value plus 1.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly handles arrays with a single element. It's important to ensure that the function works correctly for this edge case, as it represents the minimum non-empty input.

Scenario 3: Array with Multiple Elements, Positive Integers Only

Details:
  Description: Test the function with an array containing multiple positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a slice with multiple positive integers.
  Act: Invoke getCountArrayLength with this slice.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the maximum value in the array plus 1.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the core functionality of the function for a typical use case. It ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum value and returns the appropriate count array length for positive integers.

Scenario 4: Array with Negative and Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior with an array containing both negative and positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with a mix of negative and positive integers.
  Act: Call getCountArrayLength with this mixed-value slice.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the maximum positive value plus 1, ignoring negative values.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for understanding how the function handles negative numbers. It ensures that negative values don't affect the result and that the function focuses only on the maximum positive value.

Scenario 5: Array with All Zero Values

Details:
  Description: Test the function with an array where all elements are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a slice containing only zero values.
  Act: Call getCountArrayLength with this zero-filled slice.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  This edge case tests how the function behaves when all elements are the same and equal to zero. It's important to verify that the function correctly returns 1 in this case, as per its implementation.

Scenario 6: Array with Large Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: Test the function's behavior with very large positive integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with some very large positive integer values.
  Act: Invoke getCountArrayLength with this large-value slice.
  Assert: Check that the function correctly returns the maximum value plus 1, even for large numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large integer values without overflow or other issues. It's important for verifying the function's robustness with extreme inputs.

Scenario 7: Array with Duplicate Maximum Values

Details:
  Description: Test the function with an array containing multiple occurrences of the maximum value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a slice where the maximum value appears multiple times.
  Act: Call getCountArrayLength with this slice.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct result based on the maximum value.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly identifies the maximum value even when it appears multiple times in the array. It tests the function's ability to consistently find the maximum regardless of its frequency or position in the array.
```

These scenarios cover a range of cases including normal operation, edge cases, and potential error conditions, providing a comprehensive test suite for the `getCountArrayLength` function.
