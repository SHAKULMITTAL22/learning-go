Here are some test scenarios for the `getCountArrayLength` function:

### Scenario 1: Empty Array

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the function when given an empty array. The function should return 1, as per the logic implemented for empty inputs.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare an empty array as input.
  - Act: Call `getCountArrayLength` with the empty array.
  - Assert: Verify that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function aligns with predefined behavior for empty inputs, fulfilling the requirement to handle such cases gracefully.

### Scenario 2: Array of Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test validates that the function returns the correct length for an array of positive integers.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Create an array with distinct positive integers, e.g., `[1, 3, 7, 5]`.
  - Act: Invoke `getCountArrayLength` with this array.
  - Assert: Ensure the function returns `8`, which is the highest value (`7`) plus one.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms the function's ability to determine the correct count array length from positive integers, an essential capability for counting sort.

### Scenario 3: Array with Repeated Highest Value

Details:
  Description: Checks how the function deals with an array where the highest value appears multiple times.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Use an array such as `[2, 5, 5, 3]`.
  - Act: Execute the function with this input.
  - Assert: Confirm that it returns `6`, which reflects the highest value plus one.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles duplicate values correctly, reinforcing its reliability in various input scenarios.

### Scenario 4: Single Element Array

Details:
  Description: This scenario checks the correctness when the array contains only a single element.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Have a single-element array like `[4]`.
  - Act: Call the function with this array.
  - Assert: Verify it returns `5`.
Validation:
  Tests the function's accuracy and stability when dealing with minimal input, ensuring it performs as expected.

### Scenario 5: Array with Negative and Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test assesses how the function handles arrays containing both negative and positive integers.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Use an array such as `[-2, 1, 4, 0]`.
  - Act: Execute the function.
  - Assert: Check that the result is `5`.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures robustness against arrays containing both positive and negative numbers, vital for broad applicability.

### Scenario 6: Array with All Negative Integers

Details:
  Description: Determines the function's handling of arrays consisting entirely of negative integers.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare an array like `[-3, -1, -5, -4]`.
  - Act: Use this array as input for the function.
  - Assert: Confirm the function returns `0` since the highest (least negative) integer when added to one is zero.
Validation:
  Validates function's behavior in edge cases dealing with negative-only arrays, ensuring no erroneous results.

### Scenario 7: Large Range of Numbers

Details:
  Description: Tests the function with a wide range of values to challenge its computation limits and correctness.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Use an extensive array range like `[0, 100, 200]`.
  - Act: Call `getCountArrayLength`.
  - Assert: Check that it returns `201`.
Validation:
  Confirms the function correctly scales with input size, proving effective for practical use with variable data ranges.

Each of these tests is crucial to verify the function's reliability across various expected and boundary conditions.
