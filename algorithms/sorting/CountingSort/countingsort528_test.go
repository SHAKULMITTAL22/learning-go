Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: learning-go/algorithms/sorting/CountingSort/countingsort_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestSelectionSort]

Based on the provided function `countingSort`, here are several test scenarios to consider:

```
Scenario 1: Sort an array with positive integers

Details:
  Description: Test the basic functionality of countingSort with a simple array of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an unsorted array of positive integers.
  Act: Call countingSort with the prepared array.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is sorted in ascending order.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of the sorting algorithm for positive integers.
  It's crucial to validate that the function can handle a typical use case correctly.

Scenario 2: Sort an array with duplicate elements

Details:
  Description: Verify that countingSort correctly handles arrays containing duplicate elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with multiple occurrences of the same integer.
  Act: Pass the array to countingSort.
  Assert: Check that the returned array is sorted and contains all original elements, including duplicates.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly counts and places duplicate elements.
  It verifies that the algorithm maintains stability for equal elements.

Scenario 3: Sort an array with zero as an element

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle zero as a valid array element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an array that includes zero along with other positive integers.
  Act: Call countingSort with this array.
  Assert: Confirm that zero is correctly positioned in the sorted output.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because zero is a special case that might be treated differently in some implementations.
  It ensures the function correctly handles the full range of non-negative integers.

Scenario 4: Sort an already sorted array

Details:
  Description: Verify that countingSort works correctly on an already sorted input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sorted array of integers.
  Act: Pass the sorted array to countingSort.
  Assert: Check that the returned array is identical to the input array.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function doesn't introduce errors when processing already sorted data.
  It's important for efficiency and correctness in real-world scenarios where data might already be sorted.

Scenario 5: Sort an array with a single element

Details:
  Description: Test the edge case of sorting an array containing only one element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with a single integer.
  Act: Call countingSort with this single-element array.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is identical to the input array.
Validation:
  This edge case test ensures the function handles minimal input correctly.
  It's important to verify that the algorithm doesn't break or produce unexpected results for small inputs.

Scenario 6: Sort an empty array

Details:
  Description: Verify the behavior of countingSort when given an empty array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty integer array.
  Act: Pass the empty array to countingSort.
  Assert: Check that the function returns an empty array.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for handling edge cases and preventing potential null pointer exceptions.
  It ensures the function behaves correctly when given minimal valid input.

Scenario 7: Sort an array with a large range of values

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle a wide range of integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with integers ranging from 0 to a very large number.
  Act: Call countingSort with this wide-range array.
  Assert: Verify that all elements are correctly sorted in the output.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's performance and correctness with a large count array.
  It's important to ensure the algorithm scales well with a wide range of input values.
```

These scenarios cover various aspects of the `countingSort` function, including normal operations, edge cases, and potential stress conditions. They aim to thoroughly test the function's correctness and robustness.
