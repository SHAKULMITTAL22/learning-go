Test Cases:
    [TestSelectionSort]

Certainly! Let's outline several test scenarios for the `countingSort` function, covering normal operations, edge cases, and various conditions:

### Scenario 1: Sorting an Array of Distinct Integers

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly sorts an array of distinct integers in ascending order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of distinct integers, e.g., [5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4].
  Act: Call the `countingSort` function with this array.
  Assert: Verify the returned array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8].
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function should handle normal sorting tasks correctly. Verifying that distinct integers are sorted indicates basic correctness.
  Discuss the importance: This test checks basic functionality, which is crucial for asserting the core operation of the sort.

### Scenario 2: Sorting an Array with Repeated Elements

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function can sort an array containing repeated integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with repeated integers, e.g., [3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2].
  Act: Invoke `countingSort` on the array.
  Assert: Ensure the output is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3].
Validation:
  Explain: Duplicates are common in input data, so it's essential to check that they are handled appropriately.
  Discuss: Correct handling of duplicates ensures comprehensive coverage of typical input cases.

### Scenario 3: Handling an Already Sorted Array

Details:
  Description: Check that the function efficiently handles a completely sorted array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a sorted array, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
  Act: Execute `countingSort` with this array.
  Assert: Confirm the result is the unchanged sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Validation:
  Explain: Ensures that extra operations aren't performed unnecessarily on sorted data.
  Discuss: Optimizes performance checks and certifies efficiency.

### Scenario 4: Handling an Empty Array

Details:
  Description: Test the function's response to an empty array input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty array [].
  Act: Apply `countingSort` on the empty array.
  Assert: Check that the result is still an empty array [].
Validation:
  Explain: An empty list is a valid input, and valid handling shows robustness.
  Discuss: Ensures that edge case inputs don't cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

### Scenario 5: Sorting an Array with Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test sorting functionality when the array includes negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an array like [-3, -1, -2, -5, -4].
  Act: Run `countingSort` on this array.
  Assert: Verify the return array is [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1].
Validation:
  Explain: Although not usually accommodated by counting sort, itâ€™s vital to handle or document limitations.
  Discuss: Necessary for real-world applications where sanitized inputs may include negative values.

### Scenario 6: Handling a Large Range of Integers

Details:
  Description: Assess how the function deals with an array containing a large range of integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Construct an array covering a wide range, e.g., [0, 1000, 5, 600, 50].
  Act: Invoke `countingSort` on the input.
  Assert: Ensure correct ordering like [0, 5, 50, 600, 1000].
Validation:
  Explain: Checks algorithm efficiency and range handling, crucial for broad input scenarios.
  Discuss: Tests the limits for input ranges, essential for scaling and performance considerations.

These scenarios span typical, edge, and special-case inputs to provide a comprehensive testing scope for the `countingSort` function. Adjustments or caveats concerning negative numbers highlight necessary preconditions or constraints of typical counting sort implementations.
