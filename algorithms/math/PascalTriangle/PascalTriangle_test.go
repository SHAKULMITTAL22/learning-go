### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality Test with a Small Height

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the `pascalTriangle` function by requesting a small triangle of height 3. The expected result should match a well-defined Pascal's Triangle for height 3.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the expected output for a Pascal's triangle of height 3.
  Act: Call the `pascalTriangle` function with the height parameter set to 3.
  Assert: Compare the output of the function with the expected result using a deep equality check.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion here is a deep equality check because the output is a slice of slices, and we need to ensure each element matches exactly. This test is important as it verifies that the function can correctly compute a simple, small Pascal's Triangle, which is a fundamental capability of this function.

### Scenario 2: Test with Height Zero

Details:
  Description: This test aims to verify the behavior of the `pascalTriangle` function when given a height of zero, expecting an empty slice of slices as the output, representing an empty Pascal's Triangle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Expect an empty slice of slices as the result.
  Act: Call the `pascalTriangle` function with the height parameter set to 0.
  Assert: Check if the returned slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion for an empty result validates that the function gracefully handles the edge case of zero height without errors and correctly represents an empty triangle. This test is crucial for ensuring the function's robustness and correct behavior under minimal input conditions.

### Scenario 3: Test with Negative Height

Details:
  Description: Testing the function with a negative height to see if it can handle incorrect inputs by either returning an empty triangle or handling the situation gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare for an expected empty output or error handling.
  Act: Call the `pascalTriangle` function with a negative height value.
  Assert: Ensure the output is either empty or appropriately handled.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's resilience against invalid input values. The expected behavior in robust systems would typically be to not fail unpredictably but to handle such cases gracefully, either through controlled outputs or specific error messages.

### Scenario 4: Test with Large Height

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the `pascalTriangle` function's performance and correctness when calculating a large Pascal's Triangle, such as a height of 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement since the output will be too large to manually verify each value.
  Act: Call the `pascalTriangle` function with the height set to 100.
  Assert: Validate key properties such as the symmetry of the triangle and the correct values at known positions (like the edges).
Validation:
  While a detailed element-by-element check is impractical for large heights, verifying characteristics like symmetry and edge values helps ensure the function's correctness on a larger scale. This test is vital for assessing both the performance and scalability of the function under more demanding conditions.

These scenarios provide a comprehensive test suite covering both typical usage and edge cases to ensure the `pascalTriangle` function is robust, efficient, and correct in various circumstances.
