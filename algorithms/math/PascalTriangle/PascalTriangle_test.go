Here are several test scenarios for the `pascalTriangle` function, designed to cover a range of conditions including normal operations and edge cases:

### Scenario 1: Generate Pascal's Triangle with Height Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the input height is zero, ensuring it correctly returns an empty triangle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the height input to 0.
  Act: Call `pascalTriangle(0)`.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice `[][]int{}`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function handles the edge case of zero height correctly, which is important to ensure that the function does not crash or return invalid data when given minimal input.

### Scenario 2: Generate Pascal's Triangle with Height One

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly generates Pascal's Triangle with a height of one, which should only contain a single row with one element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the height input to 1.
  Act: Call `pascalTriangle(1)`.
  Assert: Verify the function returns `[][]int{{1}}`.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function correctly handles the smallest non-zero triangle, which is crucial for validating the base case of the recursive structure of Pascal's Triangle.

### Scenario 3: Generate Pascal's Triangle with Height Two

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly generates Pascal's Triangle with a height of two, testing the basic recursive logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the height input to 2.
  Act: Call `pascalTriangle(2)`.
  Assert: Verify the function returns `[][]int{{1}, {1, 1}}`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly generates the first two rows of Pascal's Triangle, which is important for validating the function's ability to handle small inputs and the recursive addition of elements.

### Scenario 4: Generate Pascal's Triangle with Height Five

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to generate Pascal's Triangle with a moderate height of five, testing more complex recursion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the height input to 5.
  Act: Call `pascalTriangle(5)`.
  Assert: Verify the function returns `[][]int{{1}, {1, 1}, {1, 2, 1}, {1, 3, 3, 1}, {1, 4, 6, 4, 1}}`.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function accurately computes multiple levels of the triangle, which is crucial for confirming correct recursive calculations in the triangle's generation process.

### Scenario 5: Generate Pascal's Triangle with Negative Height

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when given a negative height, which is an invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the height input to a negative value, such as -3.
  Act: Call `pascalTriangle(-3)`.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns an empty slice `[][]int{}`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function gracefully handles invalid input by returning an empty triangle, which is important for maintaining robustness and preventing runtime errors.

### Scenario 6: Generate Pascal's Triangle with Large Height

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's performance and correctness when generating a large Pascal's Triangle, such as with a height of 10.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the height input to 10.
  Act: Call `pascalTriangle(10)`.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct 10-level Pascal's Triangle.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for both performance and correctness with larger inputs, which is crucial to ensure that the function scales well and remains efficient with increased complexity.

### Scenario 7: Check Symmetry in Pascal's Triangle

Details:
  Description: This test checks that each row in Pascal's Triangle is symmetric, an inherent property of the triangle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the height input to a value greater than 1, such as 5.
  Act: Call `pascalTriangle(5)`.
  Assert: Verify that each row is symmetric, i.e., the elements are mirrored around the center.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function respects the mathematical symmetry of Pascal's Triangle, which is important for confirming the correctness of the recursive logic used to build each row.

These scenarios cover various edge cases and typical usage patterns, ensuring that the `pascalTriangle` function is robust, correct, and efficient across a range of inputs.
