### Scenario 1: Test with a positive number that is a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a positive number that is a power of two. For example, 8 (which is 2^3) should return true.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(8)`.
  Assert: The function should return true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function returns true for numbers that are powers of two. The logic behind this is that any number that is a power of two will have only one bit set in its binary representation, and `(num & (num - 1))` should be zero. This test is important to ensure the function can identify powers of two, which might be critical for performance optimizations or algorithm requirements in the application.

### Scenario 2: Test with a positive number that is not a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a positive number that is not a power of two. For example, 10 (which is not a power of two) should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(10)`.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function returns false for numbers that are not powers of two. This confirms that the function can distinguish between numbers that are and aren't powers of two, which is essential for its intended use.

### Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when passed zero, which is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(0)`.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  Zero is not a power of two, and the function should correctly return false. This test ensures that edge cases like zero are handled correctly, which is crucial for the robustness of the application.

### Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's response to negative numbers. Since the function should only handle non-negative integers, any negative input should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(-1)`.
  Assert: The function should return false.
Validation:
  Negative numbers are not considered when determining powers of two. The assertion that the function returns false for negative numbers ensures that the function excludes invalid inputs, maintaining the integrity and correctness of its operations.

### Scenario 5: Test with the maximum int value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when passed the maximum value for an int. This is important to ensure that the function handles large numbers without overflow errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(int(^uint(0) >> 1))`.
  Assert: The function should return whether the max int value is a power of two (likely false).
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness with large values, ensuring that it does not exhibit undefined behavior or overflow issues, which is critical for maintaining reliability in systems dealing with large numeric values.

// Note: The function isPowerOfTwoBitwise should properly handle the case when num is zero.
// Currently, the function will return true for `num = 0`, which is incorrect as per the definition of powers of two.
// The function should include a check to return false if `num == 0`.
