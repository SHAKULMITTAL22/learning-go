### Scenario 1: Test with a positive number that is a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a positive number that is a power of two. For example, 8 (2^3) should return true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a variable with the value 8.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the return value is true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for a true value, which is expected since 8 is a power of two (2^3). This test is important to confirm that the function can accurately identify valid powers of two, which might be critical for systems relying on bit manipulation or binary operations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a positive number that is not a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a positive number that is not a power of two. For example, 10 should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a variable with the value 10.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for a false value, which is expected since 10 is not a power of two. This test ensures that the function accurately rejects numbers that do not fit the criteria, preventing false positives in the application.

### Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test verifies whether the function correctly handles an input of zero. According to the bitwise check, zero is not considered a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a variable with the value 0.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion expects a false result since 0 & (0 - 1) equals 0, which does not satisfy the condition of being nonzero. This scenario is critical as zero is a common edge case in mathematical computations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that any negative number returns false, as negative numbers cannot be powers of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a variable with a negative value, such as -8.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the return value is false.
Validation:
  Since the function includes a specific check for negative numbers, returning false for such inputs is expected. This test is vital for ensuring the function's robustness and its ability to handle invalid, out-of-scope inputs.

### Scenario 5: Test with the maximum int value

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when passed the maximum int value, which is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a variable with the value `int(^uint(0) >> 1)` (maximum int value).
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the return value is false.
Validation:
  The assertion expects a false result because the maximum int value is not a power of two. This test examines the function's performance and correctness under extreme values, ensuring stability and reliability in high-boundary conditions.

These scenarios collectively ensure comprehensive testing of the function across typical, boundary, and erroneous inputs, confirming its correctness and robustness in varied operational contexts.

// Currently, the function returns true for 0 because (0 & (0 - 1)) == 0. This is a logical error in the function.
// Suggested modification:
// func isPowerOfTwoBitwise(num int) bool {
//     if num <= 0 {
//         return false
//     }
//     return (num & (num - 1)) == 0
// }
