### Scenario 1: Test with a positive power of two

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a number that is a positive power of two to ensure it returns true. Numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8 are powers of two and should return true when passed to the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a number that is a known power of two, such as 8.
  Act: Call `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(8)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to verify that the function correctly identifies powers of two. This test validates the function's ability to recognize and affirm numbers that are powers of two, which is crucial for correct behavior in scenarios where binary operations depend on such conditions.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-power of two

Details:
  Description: Ensure the function returns false for numbers that are not powers of two. Numbers like 3, 6, and 7 do not fit the criteria and should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a non-power of two number, such as 7.
  Act: Call `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(7)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  This assertion checks the function's ability to correctly identify and reject numbers that are not powers of two. It's essential for maintaining accurate logic in applications where the distinction between powers and non-powers of two can affect program flow or outcomes.

### Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: Test how the function behaves when zero is passed, since zero is not a power of two and should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use zero as the test input.
  Act: Call `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(0)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  Zero is a special case and is technically not a power of two, thus expecting false is logical. It's important to confirm that the function handles this edge case correctly to avoid incorrect computations in zero-related scenarios.

### Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function returns false for any negative number since negative numbers cannot be powers of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a negative number like -2 as the input.
  Act: Call `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(-2)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation:
  Since the function includes a check for negative numbers and explicitly returns false, this test ensures that this path is working as intended. Handling negative numbers correctly prevents logical errors in mathematical operations involving powers of two.

### Scenario 5: Test with the maximum positive integer

Details:
  Description: Check the function's response when the maximum positive integer is used as input. This tests the function's robustness and handling of large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the maximum value for an integer (e.g., `int(^uint(0) >> 1)`).
  Act: Call the function with this value.
  Assert: Assert whether the result is true or false based on whether the number is a power of two.
Validation:
  Testing with the upper boundary of integer values ensures that the function handles large inputs without overflow or errors. This scenario is crucial for applications where integer limits might be reached, maintaining stability and reliability.
