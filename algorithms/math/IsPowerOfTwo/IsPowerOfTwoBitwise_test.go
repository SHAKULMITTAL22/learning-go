Here are several test scenarios for the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function, considering normal operations, edge cases, and error handling:

```
Scenario 1: Verify function returns true for a positive power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a number that is a power of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a positive integer that is a power of two, for example, 8.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The number 8 (1000 in binary) is a power of two, so the function should return true. The bitwise operation should validate this condition.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies powers of two, a core requirement of its functionality.

Scenario 2: Verify function returns false for a positive non-power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a number that is not a power of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a positive integer that is not a power of two, such as 10.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The number 10 (1010 in binary) is not a power of two, so the function should return false.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function does not falsely identify non-powers of two as powers of two.

Scenario 3: Verify function returns false for zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the input is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 0.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Zero is not a power of two, so the function should return false.
    Discuss the importance of the test: Handling zero correctly is important as it is a common edge case.

Scenario 4: Verify function returns false for a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with negative numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a negative integer, for example, -8.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Negative numbers cannot be powers of two in the context of this function, so it should return false.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function handles invalid input (negative numbers) correctly.

Scenario 5: Verify function returns true for the smallest power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies the smallest power of two, which is 1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 1.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The number 1 (0001 in binary) is a power of two, so the function should return true.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies the smallest possible power of two.

Scenario 6: Verify function returns true for a large power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle large numbers that are powers of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a large power of two, such as 1024.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The number 1024 (10000000000 in binary) is a power of two, so the function should return true.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function can handle large inputs accurately.

Scenario 7: Verify function returns false for a large non-power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with large numbers that are not powers of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a large non-power of two, such as 1025.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The number 1025 is not a power of two, so the function should return false.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function can accurately identify non-powers of two even when the numbers are large.
```

These scenarios cover a variety of cases, ensuring that the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function behaves correctly under normal, edge, and erroneous conditions.
