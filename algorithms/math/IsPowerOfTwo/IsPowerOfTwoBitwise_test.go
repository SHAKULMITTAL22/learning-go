### Scenario 1: Test with a positive power of two

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a number that is a positive power of two to ensure it returns true. This test validates the primary functionality of determining if a number is a power of two using bitwise operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a number that is a power of two, such as 8 (2^3).
  Act: Call `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(8)`.
  Assert: Check that the return value is true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly identifies a power of two. The bitwise operation `(num & (num - 1))` should equal 0 for powers of two. This test is crucial for confirming that the function performs its intended primary check accurately.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-power of two positive integer

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function returns false when provided with a positive integer that is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a non-power of two number, such as 10.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(10)`.
  Assert: Expect the return value to be false.
Validation:
  The function should correctly identify numbers that are not powers of two. For non-powers of two, the expression `(num & (num - 1))` will not equal 0, which is the behavior this test confirms. This scenario is essential to ensure the function does not incorrectly classify non-powers as powers of two.

### Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: Check the function's response when zero is passed as an argument, expecting a return of false because zero is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use zero as the test input.
  Act: Execute `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(0)`.
  Assert: The result should be false.
Validation:
  Zero is a special case as it is not a power of two, and the function should handle this correctly. This test ensures that the function has the necessary safeguards for special numeric inputs like zero.

### Scenario 4: Test with one

Details:
  Description: Test the function with the number one, which is 2^0, hence technically a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input the number one.
  Act: Call `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(1)`.
  Assert: Verify the output is true.
Validation:
  Since one is a power of two (2^0), the function should return true. This test is important to confirm that the edge case of the smallest power of two is handled correctly.

### Scenario 5: Test with a negative integer

Details:
  Description: Ensure the function returns false when a negative integer is passed, as negative numbers cannot be powers of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a negative number like -4.
  Act: Run `isPowerOfTwoBitwise(-4)`.
  Assert: Expect false as the outcome.
Validation:
  The function includes a specific check for negative numbers, returning false immediately. This test validates that this safeguard is functioning correctly, preventing incorrect classifications of negative numbers. This is vital for the robustness and accuracy of the function.
