### Scenario 1: Test with a positive number that is a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a positive number that is a power of two. For example, 8 (which is 2^3) should return true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a variable with the value 8.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the return value is true, which is expected for a power of two. This test is crucial as it validates the primary functionality of the function, ensuring it identifies powers of two correctly.

### Scenario 2: Test with a positive number that is not a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies if the function correctly identifies a positive number that is not a power of two, such as 6.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a variable with the value 6.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the return value is false, as 6 is not a power of two. This test helps confirm that the function accurately rejects non-power of two numbers, ensuring reliable functionality.

### Scenario 3: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when zero is passed as an argument. According to the function's logic, zero should return false as it's not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a variable with the value 0.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the return value is false. This test is important to ensure that edge cases like zero are handled correctly and do not mistakenly return true.

### Scenario 4: Test with the smallest power of two (1)

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's ability to identify the smallest power of two, which is 1 (2^0).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a variable with the value 1.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the function returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the return value is true, as 1 is technically a power of two. This test is essential for ensuring the function handles boundary cases of the smallest powers of two.

### Scenario 5: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with negative numbers, which should return false as they cannot be powers of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a variable with a negative value, such as -2.
  Act: Invoke `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` with this variable.
  Assert: Check if the function returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the return value is false. Negative numbers are not powers of two, and this test ensures that the function correctly identifies and handles such inputs.

These scenarios comprehensively cover the function's expected behavior across typical, boundary, and erroneous cases, ensuring robust testing of all aspects of the function's logic.
