Here are several test scenarios for the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function, considering normal operations, edge cases, and error handling:

```
Scenario 1: Verify function returns true for a positive power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a number that is a power of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Define a positive integer that is a power of two, for example, 8.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks if 8 is recognized as a power of two, which it is (2^3). The test is important to ensure the function correctly identifies valid powers of two.

Scenario 2: Verify function returns false for a positive non-power of two

Details:
  Description: This test ensures the function returns false for numbers that are not powers of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Choose a positive integer that is not a power of two, like 7.
    Act: Pass this number to the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function.
    Assert: Confirm the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks that 7 is not identified as a power of two, which is correct. This test is crucial to verify that the function does not mistakenly identify non-powers of two as powers of two.

Scenario 3: Verify function returns false for zero

Details:
  Description: The test examines the behavior of the function when zero is passed, which is not a power of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use the integer 0 as input.
    Act: Invoke the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with zero.
    Assert: Ensure the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Zero is not a power of two, so the function should return false. This test checks that the function handles this edge case correctly.

Scenario 4: Verify function returns false for negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's handling of negative numbers, which cannot be powers of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Select a negative integer, such as -4.
    Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Negative numbers are not powers of two, so the expected result is false. This test ensures the function correctly handles negative inputs.

Scenario 5: Verify function returns true for the smallest power of two

Details:
  Description: Test the function with the smallest power of two, which is 1.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use the integer 1 as input.
    Act: Pass 1 to the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function.
    Assert: Confirm the function returns true.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The number 1 is 2^0, a power of two, so the function should return true. This test checks the function's correctness for the lower boundary of powers of two.

Scenario 6: Verify function returns false for large non-power of two

Details:
  Description: This test ensures the function can handle large numbers that are not powers of two.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Choose a large integer, such as 1000000, which is not a power of two.
    Act: Invoke the `isPowerOfTwoBitwise` function with this number.
    Assert: Verify the function returns false.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion checks that 1000000 is not mistakenly identified as a power of two, which it is not. This test is important to confirm the function's reliability with large inputs.
```

These scenarios cover a range of inputs, including positive powers of two, non-powers of two, zero, negative numbers, and edge cases, ensuring comprehensive validation of the function's behavior.
