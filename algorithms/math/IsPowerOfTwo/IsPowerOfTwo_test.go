### Scenario 1: Test with a number that is a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies numbers that are powers of two. A power of two means that it can be expressed as 2 raised to the power of some integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a number that is a known power of two, such as 8 (which is 2^3).
  Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwo` function with the number 8.
  Assert: The function should return `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function returns `true` for a valid power of two. This test is crucial as it validates the primary functionality of the function, ensuring it meets its specification for expected inputs.

### Scenario 2: Test with a number that is not a power of two

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly identify numbers that are not powers of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a number that is not a power of two, such as 7.
  Act: Invoke the `isPowerOfTwo` function with the number 7.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion here is to confirm that the function does not mistakenly identify non-powers as powers of two. It's important for the reliability of the function in scenarios where precise checks are needed.

### Scenario 3: Test with the smallest non-power of two greater than one

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies the smallest integer greater than one that is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 3, which is the smallest non-power of two greater than one.
  Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwo` function with the number 3.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `false`.
Validation:
  This test is significant because numbers close to powers of two (like 3, which is near 2^1) can be edge cases in some implementations. Ensuring accuracy here helps guarantee the function's robustness.

### Scenario 4: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: Tests the function's response when provided with 0, which is not a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 0.
  Act: Invoke the `isPowerOfTwo` function with the number 0.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Zero is a special case that needs explicit handling, as assuming any power of 2 multiplied by zero is zero, not a power of two. This test ensures that such edge cases are correctly managed.

### Scenario 5: Test with negative numbers

Details:
  Description: Ensure the function handles negative numbers, which cannot be powers of two, correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a negative number like -4.
  Act: Call the `isPowerOfTwo` function with -4.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Negative numbers are not powers of two, and this test confirms that the function does not return incorrect results for such inputs. This is crucial for the function's accuracy across all possible integer inputs.

### Scenario 6: Test with the number one

Details:
  Description: Verify that the function handles the number 1 correctly, which is 2^0 and thus a power of two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 1.
  Act: Invoke the `isPowerOfTwo` function with 1.
  Assert: The function should return `true`.
Validation:
  The number 1 is a boundary case (2^0) and must be checked to ensure the function's correctness at the boundary of its operational definition. This test is essential to confirm full coverage of potential power-of-two values.

// Suggested improvement in business logic:
// - Consider handling the case for num == 1 directly, as it is a power of 2 (2^0).
// - Modify the initial condition to `if num < 1` to correctly return false for 0 and negative numbers.
