### Scenario 1: Basic Positive Modulus
Details:
  Description: Test the function with two positive integers where the first integer is larger than the second. This scenario checks the basic functionality of the modulus operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = 10 and b = 3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to the expected modulus result, which should be 1.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the modulus operation is correctly implemented for positive integers. The expected result is derived from standard arithmetic rules, confirming the function handles simple positive modulus correctly. This test is crucial for verifying basic arithmetic operations in the application.

### Scenario 2: Zero as Divisor
Details:
  Description: Test the function using zero as the divisor to ensure the function handles or reports errors appropriately, as division by zero is undefined in mathematics.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 5 and b = 0.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle or report the error gracefully.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function deals with an undefined mathematical operation, which is crucial for preventing runtime errors in the application. Proper error handling or reporting is essential for robust application behavior.

### Scenario 3: Negative Dividend
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a negative dividend and a positive divisor to verify correct adjustment in the modulus calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -10 and b = 3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is 2, as the function should adjust for the negative input.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the modulus operation correctly adjusts when the dividend is negative and the divisor is positive. This test is important for ensuring the mathematical accuracy of the application under different signs of input values.

### Scenario 4: Negative Divisor
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a positive dividend and a negative divisor to see how it handles the negative divisor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 10 and b = -3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is -2, following the expected adjustment for negative divisor.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's behavior with negative divisors, which is essential for ensuring that the application handles various mathematical scenarios correctly. The importance of this test lies in verifying that the function can manage different signs for divisors accurately.

### Scenario 5: Both Negative Numbers
Details:
  Description: Test the function when both numbers are negative to ensure the modulus is adjusted correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -10 and b = -3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is -1.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function properly adjusts the modulus result when both the dividend and divisor are negative. This test is crucial for confirming that the function adheres to mathematical rules even under less common scenarios.

### Scenario 6: Positive Dividend, Zero Modulus
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a dividend that is exactly divisible by the divisor to confirm it returns zero as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 12 and b = 3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function returns the correct result when the dividend is perfectly divisible by the divisor. It's important for validating the correctness of the modulus operation in straightforward cases.
