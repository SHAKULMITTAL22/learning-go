### Scenario 1: Basic Positive Modulus
Details:
  Description: Test the function with two positive integers where the first integer is larger than the second. This scenario checks the basic functionality of the modulus operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = 10, b = 3.
  Act: Call mod(10, 3).
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to 1.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the result of 10 % 3 equals 1, which is the mathematical expectation. This test is important to confirm that the function handles basic positive modulus operations correctly.

### Scenario 2: Zero as Divisor
Details:
  Description: Test the function when the divisor (b) is zero, which should typically raise an error or handle a special case since division by zero is undefined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 10, b = 0.
  Act: Call mod(10, 0).
  Assert: Expect the function to handle the error or define specific behavior.
Validation:
  Since Go's modulus with zero as divisor can panic or behave unexpectedly, the function should ideally handle this case gracefully. This test ensures robustness in face of runtime errors.

### Scenario 3: Negative Dividend
Details:
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adjusts the result when the dividend (a) is negative and the divisor (b) is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -10, b = 3.
  Act: Call mod(-10, 3).
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to 2.
Validation:
  This test checks the special handling in the function where it adjusts the result by adding b when a is negative and b is positive. It ensures that the function provides a correct positive remainder in such cases.

### Scenario 4: Negative Divisor
Details:
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly adjusts the result when the divisor (b) is negative and the dividend (a) is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 10, b = -3.
  Act: Call mod(10, -3).
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to -2.
Validation:
  This test verifies the adjustment made by subtracting b when both a and b are negative. It is crucial for maintaining consistent behavior of modulus operation across different signs of inputs.

### Scenario 5: Both Negative
Details:
  Description: Test the function when both the dividend and the divisor are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = -10, b = -3.
  Act: Call mod(-10, -3).
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to -1.
Validation:
  The function adds b when both a and b are negative, according to its implementation. This test is important to ensure that the function handles negative values correctly and adheres to the expected mathematical rules of modulus.

### Scenario 6: Large Numbers
Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle large integers accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a = 1234567890, b = 12345.
  Act: Call mod(1234567890, 12345).
  Assert: Check if the result matches the expected modulus result.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's performance and correctness with large numbers, ensuring that it remains accurate and efficient under such conditions. This is crucial for applications that may need to handle large numeric computations.
