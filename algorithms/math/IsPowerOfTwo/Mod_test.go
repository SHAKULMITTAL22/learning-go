### Scenario 1: Basic Positive Modulus
Details:
  Description: Test the function with two positive integers where the first integer is larger than the second. This scenario checks the basic functionality of the modulus operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = 10 and b = 3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to 1, which is the expected modulus.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the remainder of 10 divided by 3 is correctly calculated as 1. This basic check validates that the function handles standard positive values correctly.

### Scenario 2: Negative Dividend
Details:
  Description: Test the function when the first integer is negative, and the second is positive to validate the adjustment of the result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = -10 and b = 3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to 2, considering the adjustment for negative dividends.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function correctly adjusts the modulus result when the dividend is negative, which is crucial for correct mathematical results in such cases.

### Scenario 3: Negative Divisor
Details:
  Description: Test the function with a positive dividend and a negative divisor to check the behavior without adjustments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = 10 and b = -3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to 1.
Validation:
  The validation checks that the modulus is calculated as usual without adjustment since only the divisor is negative. This test confirms that the function adheres to the mathematical standards for modulus operations.

### Scenario 4: Both Negative
Details:
  Description: Test the function with both integers negative to evaluate the adjustment mechanism.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = -10 and b = -3.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is equal to -2 after adjusting for both negative values.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly applies adjustments when both dividend and divisor are negative, which is important for maintaining consistency in modulus operations across different numerical scenarios.

### Scenario 5: Zero Dividend
Details:
  Description: Test the function with zero as the dividend to verify it handles this edge case correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = 0 and b = 5.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the modulus of zero with any non-zero integer is zero, which is a fundamental property of modulus operations.

### Scenario 6: One as Divisor
Details:
  Description: Test the function with one as the divisor, which should always result in zero regardless of the dividend.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = 10 and b = 1.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the divisor is one, as the modulus in such cases should always be zero, representing a basic yet crucial mathematical rule.

### Scenario 7: Divisor Greater Than Dividend
Details:
  Description: Test the function where the divisor is greater than the dividend to check the modulus result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose integers such as a = 3 and b = 10.
  Act: Call the `mod` function with these values.
  Assert: Check if the result is 3.
Validation:
  This checks that when the divisor is larger than the dividend, the modulus is the dividend itself, which is an important case to verify for correct modulus operation.
