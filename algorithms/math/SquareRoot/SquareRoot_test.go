### Test Scenarios for `squareRoot` Function

**Scenario 1: Positive Number with Perfect Square**

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a positive number that has an exact square root to ensure it calculates the root correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a number like 16, which has a known square root.
  Act: Call `squareRoot(16)`.
  Assert: Check if the result is 4.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for equality between the expected result (4) and the actual function output. This test is vital to confirm that the function correctly computes the square root for perfect squares, which is a basic and expected capability of the square root function.

**Scenario 2: Positive Number without Perfect Square**

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a positive number that does not have an exact square root to verify the function's accuracy with floating point results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a number like 2.
  Act: Call `squareRoot(2)`.
  Assert: Check if the result is close to approximately 1.414.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the output is within an acceptable range of the mathematical square root of 2. This test is crucial as it checks the function's precision and effectiveness in handling numbers that do not have perfect square roots.

**Scenario 3: Zero as Input**

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the function handles zero correctly, which should return a square root of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input is 0.
  Act: Call `squareRoot(0)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  This assertion directly checks for equality with 0, as the square root of 0 is definitively 0. This test is important for verifying the function's handling of edge cases and ensuring correct behavior with minimal inputs.

**Scenario 4: Negative Number**

Details:
  Description: Confirm that the function handles negative numbers properly by returning -1, indicating an error or invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input a negative number, e.g., -4.
  Act: Call `squareRoot(-4)`.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is -1.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for equality with -1, which is the designated return value for invalid inputs (negative numbers in this case). This test is critical for error handling and ensures the function gracefully manages unsupported values.

**Scenario 5: Large Number**

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle very large numbers and still compute the square root accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a large number such as 1e10 (10000000000).
  Act: Call `squareRoot(1e10)`.
  Assert: Check if the result is close to 100000.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the output is approximately equal to the mathematical square root of the large number. This test assesses the function's robustness and its capability to process and return accurate results for large values, which is essential for applications dealing with a wide range of input sizes.

These scenarios cover a range of typical use cases and edge cases, ensuring that the `squareRoot` function behaves as expected across different types of inputs and correctly handles both valid and invalid scenarios.
