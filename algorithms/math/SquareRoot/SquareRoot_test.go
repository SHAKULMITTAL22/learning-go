Here are several test scenarios for the `squareRoot` function. These scenarios cover normal operations, edge cases, and error handling.

### Scenario 1: Positive Number Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to calculate the square root of a positive number, which is a standard use case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a positive float number, e.g., `num := 16.0`.
    Act: Call the function `squareRoot(num)`.
    Assert: Verify that the result is approximately `4.0`, which is the square root of 16.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The test expects the function to return a value close to 4.0. This is important to ensure the function accurately computes square roots for positive numbers, which is a fundamental requirement.

### Scenario 2: Zero Input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's handling of zero, which has a known square root of zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the input `num := 0.0`.
    Act: Invoke `squareRoot(num)`.
    Assert: Check that the result is `0.0`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected result is 0.0 because the square root of zero is zero. This test ensures that the function correctly handles this edge case.

### Scenario 3: Negative Number Input

Details:
  Description: This test examines the function's behavior when given a negative input, which should return -1 as per the function's logic.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a negative float number, e.g., `num := -4.0`.
    Act: Execute `squareRoot(num)`.
    Assert: Confirm that the result is `-1.0`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The function is expected to return -1.0 for negative inputs, indicating an invalid operation (since the square root of a negative number is not real). This test is crucial for error handling.

### Scenario 4: Small Positive Number Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle small positive numbers, ensuring precision and accuracy.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set `num := 0.0001`.
    Act: Call `squareRoot(num)`.
    Assert: Validate that the result is approximately `0.01`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected result is 0.01, as it is the square root of 0.0001. This test is important to verify the function's precision with small numbers.

### Scenario 5: Large Positive Number Input

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's performance and accuracy with large positive numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare a large number, e.g., `num := 1000000.0`.
    Act: Invoke `squareRoot(num)`.
    Assert: Ensure the result is approximately `1000.0`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected result is 1000.0, the square root of 1,000,000. This test ensures that the function can handle large inputs without precision issues.

### Scenario 6: Floating Point Precision

Details:
  Description: This test assesses how the function deals with floating point precision issues.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use a number with a known square root, e.g., `num := 2.0`.
    Act: Call `squareRoot(num)`.
    Assert: Verify the result is close to `1.414213`, the square root of 2, using a tolerance for floating point precision.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The result should be close to 1.414213. This test is critical to ensure that the function maintains accuracy despite floating point limitations.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `squareRoot` function handles a variety of inputs correctly, covering typical use cases and edge cases, and providing a robust validation of its behavior.
