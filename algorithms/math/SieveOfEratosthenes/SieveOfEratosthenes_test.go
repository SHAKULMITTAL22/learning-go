### Test Scenarios for the `sieveOfEratosthenes` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test with small prime limit
Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify all prime numbers up to a small number (e.g., 10).
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the maximum number as 10.
  Act: Invoke the `sieveOfEratosthenes` function with this maximum number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned slice matches the expected list of primes up to 10, which are [2, 3, 5, 7].
Validation:
  The assertion checks for the exact match of the slice against the expected primes. This test is crucial for verifying basic correctness of the Sieve of Eratosthenes implementation in handling small numbers.

#### Scenario 2: Test with zero as input
Details:
  Description: This test verifies how the function handles an input of zero, expecting an empty list of primes since there are no positive integers <= 0 that are prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the maximum number as 0.
  Act: Invoke the `sieveOfEratosthenes` function with this maximum number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned slice is empty.
Validation:
  An empty slice output validates that the function correctly handles the edge case of zero, which might be a common error point. This test ensures that the function's boundary conditions are properly set.

#### Scenario 3: Test with negative number input
Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's response to a negative number input, which logically should return an empty list since negative numbers cannot be prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the maximum number to -5.
  Act: Invoke the function with this number.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned slice is empty.
Validation:
  Testing with negative numbers ensures the function is robust against invalid input, maintaining integrity by not crashing or behaving unpredictably.

#### Scenario 4: Test with large number input
Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's performance and correctness when calculating primes up to a large number, such as 1000.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the maximum number to 1000.
  Act: Invoke the function with this number.
  Assert: Verify that the returned slice includes specific known primes and matches the length expected for primes up to 1000.
Validation:
  This test is important for assessing both the correctness over a larger range and the performance implications of the sieve algorithm. It helps ensure scalability of the function.

#### Scenario 5: Test with one as input
Details:
  Description: Testing the function with an input of 1 should return an empty list, since the only number (1) is not a prime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the maximum number to 1.
  Act: Invoke the function with this number.
  Assert: Ensure the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The output is expected to be empty as 1 is not a prime number. This test checks the function's correctness in handling the boundary condition of the smallest non-zero integer.

These scenarios cover a range of inputs including typical small numbers, boundary conditions, and larger numbers to ensure the function behaves as expected across different situations, thereby confirming its reliability and correctness.
