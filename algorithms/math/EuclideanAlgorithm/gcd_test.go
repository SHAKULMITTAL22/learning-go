Based on the provided function GCD, which calculates the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm, here are several test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Basic GCD Calculation

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with two positive integers to verify correct calculation of their greatest common divisor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, e.g., 48 and 18.
  Act: Call GCD(48, 18).
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 6, which is the correct GCD of 48 and 18.
Validation:
  This test ensures the core functionality of the GCD function works correctly for typical inputs. It's crucial as it validates the basic implementation of the Euclidean algorithm.

Scenario 2: GCD with One Number Being Zero

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function when one of the input numbers is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare one non-zero integer and zero, e.g., 15 and 0.
  Act: Call GCD(15, 0) and GCD(0, 15).
  Assert: Verify that both calls return 15.
Validation:
  This test checks the edge case where one number is zero. The GCD of a number and 0 should always be the absolute value of the non-zero number. It's important to test both parameter orders to ensure the function handles them correctly.

Scenario 3: GCD of Negative Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with negative integers to ensure it handles them correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, e.g., -48 and -18.
  Act: Call GCD(-48, -18).
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 6, same as for positive numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles negative inputs. The GCD should be positive regardless of the sign of inputs, so this test verifies that the function adheres to this mathematical property.

Scenario 4: GCD of Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with two prime numbers to verify it returns 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose two prime numbers, e.g., 17 and 19.
  Act: Call GCD(17, 19).
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 1.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly identifies when two numbers are coprime (their only common divisor is 1). It's an important property of the GCD function, especially in cryptographic applications.

Scenario 5: GCD of Very Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function with very large integers to check for potential overflow issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two very large integers, e.g., 1234567890 and 987654321.
  Act: Call GCD(1234567890, 987654321).
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 9 (the correct GCD for these numbers).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large inputs without overflow or precision loss. It's important for robustness and reliability in real-world applications where large numbers might be used.

Scenario 6: GCD of Equal Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the GCD function when both input numbers are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose any integer, e.g., 42.
  Act: Call GCD(42, 42).
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 42.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function correctly handles the case where both inputs are identical. The GCD of a number with itself should always be that number, and this test ensures this property is maintained.

These scenarios cover a range of cases including normal operation, edge cases (zero, negative numbers, prime numbers), and potential error conditions (very large numbers). They provide a comprehensive test suite for the GCD function.
