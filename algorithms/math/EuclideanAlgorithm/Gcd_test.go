Here are several test scenarios for the `GCD` function, covering normal operations, edge cases, and potential error handling:

### Scenario 1: Basic Positive Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the `GCD` function with two positive integers. It verifies the correctness of the greatest common divisor calculation.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, say 48 and 18.
  - Act: Call the `GCD` function with these integers.
  - Assert: Verify that the result is 6, which is the greatest common divisor of 48 and 18.
  Validation:
  - The assertion is based on the mathematical definition of the GCD. This test is important to ensure that the core logic of the Euclidean algorithm is correctly implemented for typical inputs.

### Scenario 2: One Zero Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `GCD` function when one of the integers is zero. The function should return the non-zero integer as the GCD.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare inputs such as 0 and 7.
  - Act: Invoke the `GCD` function with these values.
  - Assert: Confirm that the result is 7.
  Validation:
  - When one input is zero and the other is non-zero, the GCD should be the non-zero integer. This scenario is critical for ensuring the function handles zero inputs correctly.

### Scenario 3: Both Inputs Zero

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's response when both inputs are zero. The mathematical GCD in this case is undefined, but the function should handle it gracefully.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Set up inputs 0 and 0.
  - Act: Call the `GCD` function with these inputs.
  - Assert: Validate that the function returns 0.
  Validation:
  - The expected result is 0 since GCD is typically defined as 0 for (0, 0) in practical implementations to avoid errors. This test ensures that the function can handle edge cases without crashing.

### Scenario 4: Negative and Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle a mix of negative and positive integers. It should still return the positive GCD.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Use inputs such as -48 and 18.
  - Act: Execute the `GCD` function with these numbers.
  - Assert: Ensure the result is 6.
  Validation:
  - The GCD should always be non-negative, and this test confirms that the function correctly computes the GCD even with negative inputs. This scenario is important for robust input handling.

### Scenario 5: Two Negative Integers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's performance with two negative integers. The result should be the positive GCD.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare inputs such as -48 and -18.
  - Act: Call the `GCD` function with these values.
  - Assert: Check that the result is 6.
  Validation:
  - The GCD should be positive even if both inputs are negative. This test ensures that the function properly handles negative values.

### Scenario 6: Prime Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test examines the function's ability to handle two prime numbers, where the GCD should be 1.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Use inputs such as 13 and 17.
  - Act: Execute the `GCD` function with these inputs.
  - Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
  Validation:
  - Prime numbers have no common divisors other than 1. This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly identifies when numbers are coprime.

### Scenario 7: Large Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's performance and correctness with large numbers.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Prepare large integers, such as 123456 and 789012.
  - Act: Call the `GCD` function with these inputs.
  - Assert: Ensure the result is 12.
  Validation:
  - Handling large numbers tests the efficiency and correctness of the algorithm. This scenario is important for ensuring that the function scales well with input size.

These scenarios cover a wide range of inputs, from typical use cases to edge conditions, ensuring that the `GCD` function behaves correctly across different situations.
