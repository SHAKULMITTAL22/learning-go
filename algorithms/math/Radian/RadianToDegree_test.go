Scenario 1: Conversion of a Positive Radian Value to Degrees

Details:
  Description: This test checks the correct conversion of a positive radian value to degrees, ensuring the function handles typical positive inputs accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a positive radian value, such as π/2.
  Act: Invoke the radianToDegree function with this radian value.
