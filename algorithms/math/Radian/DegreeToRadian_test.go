### Scenario 1: Convert Zero Degrees to Radians

Details:
  Description: This test checks the conversion of 0 degrees to radians. The expected result should be 0 radians since 0 degrees corresponds to no angular displacement.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required for this simple conversion.
  Act: Call `degreeToRadian` with the parameter 0.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for equality to 0. Given that 0 degrees is the neutral element in angular measurements, converting it to radians should also yield 0, which is critical for ensuring that the function handles neutral inputs correctly.

### Scenario 2: Convert Positive Degrees to Radians

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a common positive degree value, such as 180 degrees, which is known to be π radians.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup needed.
  Act: Call `degreeToRadian` with the parameter 180.
  Assert: Check that the result is approximately equal to π (math.Pi).
Validation:
  Using the math.Pi constant for comparison ensures precision in the test. Validating this conversion is essential as it confirms the function's correctness over typical use cases, representing half a rotation in both degrees and radians.

### Scenario 3: Convert Negative Degrees to Radians

Details:
  Description: Ensure the function correctly handles negative angles, such as -90 degrees, which should convert to -π/2 radians.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup needed.
  Act: Call `degreeToRadian` with the parameter -90.
  Assert: Verify that the result is approximately equal to -π/2.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle negative inputs, which is important for applications involving directional calculations or rotations in different orientations.

### Scenario 4: Convert Large Degree Values

Details:
  Description: Test the function with a large degree input to check for any potential overflow or precision issues. A value like 3600 degrees (10 full rotations) is used.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup needed.
  Act: Call `degreeToRadian` with the parameter 3600.
  Assert: The result should be approximately equal to 20π (math.Pi * 20).
Validation:
  Large values can sometimes lead to precision errors. This test ensures that the function remains accurate even with high degree inputs, which is crucial for applications involving multiple rotations or complex angular calculations.

### Scenario 5: Convert Fractional Degrees

Details:
  Description: Verify the function's precision with a fractional degree input, such as 22.5 degrees, expected to convert to π/8 radians.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup needed.
  Act: Call `degreeToRadian` with the parameter 22.5.
  Assert: The result should be approximately equal to π/8.
Validation:
  Testing with fractional degrees is important for verifying the precision of the function, especially in applications requiring fine-grained rotational movements or where small angular adjustments are critical.
