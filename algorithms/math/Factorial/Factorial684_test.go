### Scenario 1: Test with Zero Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the Factorial function when the input is zero. According to mathematical definition, the factorial of zero is 1.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input value `0`.
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the input value.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is `1`.
  
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the result is `1` because `0!` (zero factorial) is defined as `1`. This test is crucial as it validates the function's correctness at the boundary condition of zero, which is a fundamental case in factorial computation.

### Scenario 2: Test with Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the correctness of the Factorial function when provided with a typical positive integer (`5` in this case).
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the input value `5`.
  Act: Invoke the Factorial function using the input.
  Assert: Check that the output is `120`.
  
Validation:
  The expected result of `120` comes from the mathematical calculation of `5!`. This test confirms that the Factorial function handles common cases of positive integers correctly, ensuring the function's utility in typical use cases.

### Scenario 3: Test with Large Input

Details:
  Description: Tests the Factorial function's ability to handle and correctly compute the factorial of a large number, such as `20`.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the input value to `20`.
  Act: Execute the Factorial function with this input.
  Assert: Confirm that the result matches the expected factorial of `20`.
  
Validation:
  Asserting the factorial of `20` tests the functionâ€™s performance and correctness under stress with larger inputs. It's essential to ensure that the function can manage higher calculations without overflow or errors.

### Scenario 4: Test with Negative Input

Details:
  Description: Ensures that the Factorial function behaves correctly when faced with a negative input, which is mathematically undefined for factorials.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a negative input, e.g., `-5`.
  Act: Call the Factorial function with the negative input.
  Assert: Verify that the function still returns `1`, as the loop conditions prevent any multiplication from occurring.
  
Validation:
  The function is expected to return `1` because the for-loop does not execute with a start condition of `i <= num` where `num` is negative. This test is important to verify that the function does not produce erroneous or unexpected results when given invalid input.

### Scenario 5: Test with One

Details:
  Description: Checks the function's return value when computing the factorial of `1`, which should straightforwardly return `1`.
  
Execution:
  Arrange: Input is set to `1`.
  Act: Factorial function is invoked with the input.
  Assert: The output is verified to be `1`.
  
Validation:
  Since `1!` equals `1`, this test confirms that the function handles the smallest non-zero integer correctly. It's a basic check to ensure that single-step loops in the function operate as expected.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the Factorial function is tested over a range of inputs, including edge cases and typical usage scenarios, to verify both its correctness and robustness.
