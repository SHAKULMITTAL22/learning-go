### Scenario 1: Factorial of Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the FactorialRecursive function returns 1 when called with 0, as by definition, the factorial of 0 is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required since the input is a static value of 0.
  Act: Invoke the FactorialRecursive function with the parameter 0.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the mathematical definition of a factorial where 0! equals 1. It's essential to validate this base case to ensure that the recursive function correctly handles the simplest input, which also serves as a termination point for deeper recursive calls.

### Scenario 2: Factorial of Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: Test to ensure the function correctly computes the factorial of a positive integer, such as 5, where the expected result is 120.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required as the input is a static value of 5.
  Act: Invoke the FactorialRecursive function with the parameter 5.
  Assert: Check that the result is 120.
Validation:
  The assertion here checks for the correct calculation of a factorial for a non-trivial case. This test is crucial as it validates the core functionality of the recursive implementation for calculating factorials, which is a common mathematical operation.

### Scenario 3: Factorial of One

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the function with an input of 1, expecting the result to be 1 since the factorial of 1 is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required with an input of 1.
  Act: Invoke the FactorialRecursive function with 1 as the parameter.
  Assert: The result should be 1.
Validation:
  Testing with an input of 1 is important as it represents the smallest non-zero integer for which the factorial is itself. This test ensures that the recursion correctly handles the next simplest case after the base case.

### Scenario 4: Factorial of Negative Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles a negative integer input, such as -5. Since the factorial is not defined for negative numbers, the expected behavior needs to be clarified in the function's documentation or implementation.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required with an input of -5.
  Act: Invoke the FactorialRecursive function with -5 as the parameter.
  Assert: Verify the behavior (either an error is returned, or a specific value is returned as per the function's error handling).
Validation:
  Since the factorial is undefined for negative numbers, this test is crucial for ensuring robustness in the function's implementation. It should either handle this gracefully by returning a standard error or by defining a specific return value indicating an invalid input. This needs alignment with the documented behavior of the function.

### Scenario 5: Factorial of Large Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: Testing the function with a large positive integer to evaluate performance and any potential stack overflow issues due to deep recursion.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required with an input of a large number, such as 20.
  Act: Invoke the FactorialRecursive function with 20 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the result matches the expected factorial of 20.
Validation:
  This test is important for assessing the function's performance and reliability when handling larger inputs. It helps ensure that the application can handle high computational demands without crashing due to limitations in recursion depth or processing power.

Each of these scenarios helps ensure that the FactorialRecursive function operates correctly across a range of expected and edge case inputs, thus providing confidence in its reliability and correctness within the application.
