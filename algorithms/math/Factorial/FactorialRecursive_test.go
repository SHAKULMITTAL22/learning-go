Below are several test scenarios for the `FactorialRecursive` function, which calculates the factorial of a given integer recursively.

### Scenario 1: Factorial of Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the factorial function returns 1 when the input is 0, which is a mathematical base case.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Set up the input value as 0.
  - Act: Call `FactorialRecursive` with the input value.
  - Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
  Validation:
  - The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the base case of factorial calculation. The expected result of 0! is 1, which is crucial for the recursive termination condition.

### Scenario 2: Factorial of a Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly calculates the factorial of a small positive integer.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Use a small positive integer, such as 5.
  - Act: Invoke `FactorialRecursive` with this integer.
  - Assert: Ensure the result is 120 (5! = 120).
  Validation:
  - The assertion ensures the function correctly multiplies a series of descending integers. This test is important to verify the basic recursive functionality for typical inputs.

### Scenario 3: Factorial of One

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns 1 when the input is 1, which should be a straightforward calculation.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Set the input to 1.
  - Act: Call `FactorialRecursive` with the input.
  - Assert: Confirm that the result is 1.
  Validation:
  - The assertion checks the correctness for the smallest positive integer. This is important to ensure the recursive logic handles this edge case correctly.

### Scenario 4: Factorial of a Larger Positive Integer

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's performance and correctness for larger numbers, such as 10.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Choose a larger number, such as 10.
  - Act: Execute `FactorialRecursive` with this input.
  - Assert: Verify the result is 3628800 (10! = 3628800).
  Validation:
  - This test checks the function's ability to handle larger calculations without stack overflow and ensures it maintains correctness over more iterations.

### Scenario 5: Factorial of a Negative Integer

Details:
  Description: This test examines the function's behavior when given a negative number, which is not traditionally defined for factorials.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Use a negative integer, such as -5.
  - Act: Call `FactorialRecursive` with this negative integer.
  - Assert: Determine the expected behavior, possibly an error or a specific return value.
  Validation:
  - As factorials for negative numbers are undefined, this test is crucial for ensuring the function handles invalid inputs gracefully. The expected behavior should be documented, as it impacts application robustness.

### Scenario 6: Factorial of a Large Positive Integer (Performance Test)

Details:
  Description: This test is designed to check performance and stack depth handling for very large numbers.
  Execution:
  - Arrange: Select a very large number, such as 20, which is often at the edge of practical recursion depth for factorials.
  - Act: Call `FactorialRecursive` with this input.
  - Assert: Validate the result is 2432902008176640000 (20! = 2432902008176640000).
  Validation:
  - This scenario tests the function's efficiency and correctness when computing large factorials, which is important for applications requiring high performance and correctness over a wide range of inputs.

These scenarios aim to cover a broad set of conditions under which the `FactorialRecursive` function might be used, including normal cases, edge cases, and potential error conditions.
