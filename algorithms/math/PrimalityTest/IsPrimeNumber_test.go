### Scenario 1: Test with a prime number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a known prime number, for example, 13.
  Act: Call `isPrimeNumber(13)`.
  Assert: The function should return `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the return value is `true` when a prime number is provided. This validates the function's ability to recognize prime numbers, which is crucial for any applications relying on prime number validation, such as cryptographic systems.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-prime number

Details:
  Description: This test verifies if the function can identify a non-prime number. Non-prime numbers have divisors other than 1 and themselves.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a known non-prime number, such as 12.
  Act: Call `isPrimeNumber(12)`.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the return value is `false` when a non-prime number is provided. It's important to ensure that the function accurately identifies non-prime numbers to prevent incorrect calculations or operations in applications that require prime validation.

### Scenario 3: Test with the number one

Details:
  Description: This test determines whether the function properly identifies the number 1, which is not a prime number by definition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 1.
  Act: Call `isPrimeNumber(1)`.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Testing with the number 1 checks the function's adherence to the fundamental definition of prime numbers. It's crucial for the function to correctly handle this edge case to maintain mathematical accuracy.

### Scenario 4: Test with a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves when given a negative number. Since negative numbers can't be prime, the expected behavior should be well-defined.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a negative number, e.g., -7.
  Act: Call `isPrimeNumber(-7)`.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Since prime numbers are defined as greater than 1, ensuring that the function returns `false` for negative numbers is important for correctness. This test verifies that the function handles this type of input gracefully.

### Scenario 5: Test with the smallest prime number

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can identify the smallest prime number, which is 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 2.
  Act: Call `isPrimeNumber(2)`.
  Assert: The function should return `true`.
Validation:
  Since 2 is the smallest and only even prime number, it's essential that the function recognizes it correctly. This scenario is vital for validating the function's capability to handle the lower boundary of prime numbers accurately.

### Scenario 6: Test with zero

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function's response to zero. Zero is not considered a prime number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the number 0.
  Act: Call `isPrimeNumber(0)`.
  Assert: The function should return `false`.
Validation:
  Testing with zero checks if the function correctly identifies that zero is not a prime number. Handling this input correctly is necessary for ensuring the function's robustness and reliability in various computational scenarios.
