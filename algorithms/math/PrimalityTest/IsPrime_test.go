Below are several test scenarios for the `isPrime` function based on the provided function signature and package details. The scenarios cover various cases, including normal operation and edge cases.

---

Scenario 1: Check if a small prime number is correctly identified

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a small prime number, like 3, as a prime.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 3, a known prime number.
    Act: Call the `isPrime` function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `true`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion is based on the mathematical definition of prime numbers. Since 3 is a prime number, the expected result is `true`.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies small prime numbers, which is fundamental for its correct operation.

---

Scenario 2: Check if a small non-prime number is correctly identified

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a small non-prime number, like 4, as not prime.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 4, a known non-prime number.
    Act: Call the `isPrime` function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The assertion is based on the fact that 4 is divisible by 2, thus not a prime number.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly classify non-prime numbers as prime.

---

Scenario 3: Check if 1 is correctly identified as not prime

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies the number 1 as not prime.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 1.
    Act: Call the `isPrime` function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: By definition, 1 is not a prime number, so the expected result is `false`.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures the function adheres to the mathematical definition of prime numbers, where 1 is not considered prime.

---

Scenario 4: Check if a large prime number is correctly identified

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function can correctly identify a large prime number, such as 101, as prime.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 101, a known prime number.
    Act: Call the `isPrime` function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `true`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The number 101 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, thus it is prime.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function performs correctly even for larger prime numbers.

---

Scenario 5: Check if a large non-prime number is correctly identified

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a large non-prime number, such as 100, as not prime.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 100, a known non-prime number.
    Act: Call the `isPrime` function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The number 100 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 5, 10), so it is not prime.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures that the function does not incorrectly classify non-prime numbers as prime, even for larger numbers.

---

Scenario 6: Check if a negative number is correctly identified as not prime

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies negative numbers as not prime.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to -7.
    Act: Call the `isPrime` function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Negative numbers cannot be prime by definition, so the expected result is `false`.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures the function handles negative input correctly, adhering to the mathematical definition of prime numbers.

---

Scenario 7: Check if 0 is correctly identified as not prime

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies the number 0 as not prime.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the input number to 0.
    Act: Call the `isPrime` function with the input number.
    Assert: Verify that the function returns `false`.
  Validation:
    Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: By definition, 0 is not a prime number, so the expected result is `false`.
    Discuss the importance of the test: This test ensures the function handles zero input correctly, adhering to the mathematical definition of prime numbers.

---

These scenarios cover a wide range of cases, ensuring the `isPrime` function behaves as expected across different inputs.
