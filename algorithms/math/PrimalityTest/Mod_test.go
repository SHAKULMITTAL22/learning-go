ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=mod_10abfc4edf

### Scenario 1: Test with positive numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the `mod` function when both operands are positive integers. It ensures that the modulus operation is performed correctly under normal conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose two positive integers, `a` and `b`.
  Act: Call `mod(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is `a % b`.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function returns the correct modulus of two positive numbers. This test is crucial as it verifies the function's correctness under standard conditions.

### Scenario 2: Test with a negative dividend and a positive divisor

Details:
  Description: This test evaluates the function when the dividend `a` is negative, and the divisor `b` is positive. It checks the adjustment made for negative modulus values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a negative integer for `a` and a positive integer for `b`.
  Act: Call `mod(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is `(a % b) + b`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly adjusts the result when the dividend is negative and the divisor is positive, as per the function's corrective action in this scenario. This is essential for accurate modulus calculations in mixed-sign scenarios.

### Scenario 3: Test with a positive dividend and a negative divisor

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests the function's response when the dividend `a` is positive, and the divisor `b` is negative. It checks if the modulus result is adjusted correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a positive integer for `a` and a negative integer for `b`.
  Act: Call `mod(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is `a % b`, as no adjustment is needed for positive dividends with negative divisors.
Validation:
  The test verifies that no unnecessary adjustments are made when the dividend is positive, and the divisor is negative. This scenario confirms the function's behavior in managing different sign inputs without adjustments.

### Scenario 4: Test with both negative numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function when both the dividend and the divisor are negative. It ensures that the function handles the double-negative scenario correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose two negative integers, `a` and `b`.
  Act: Call `mod(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is `(a % b) - b`.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring that the function correctly adjusts the result in cases where both numbers are negative, according to the function's specified behavior. It's crucial for scenarios where negative numbers are involved in modulus operations.

### Scenario 5: Test with zero divisor

Details:
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the divisor `b` is zero, which should generally lead to a runtime panic due to division by zero in modulus operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `a` to any integer, and `b` to zero.
  Act: Attempt to call `mod(a, b)` and handle any runtime panic.
  Assert: Expect a runtime panic to occur.
Validation:
  This test is critical as it checks the robustness of the function against invalid input scenarios. Handling or documenting such edge cases is vital for the reliability of the function.

### Scenario 6: Test with zero as the dividend

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests how the function behaves when the dividend `a` is zero and any non-zero integer for `b`. It checks if the result is zero, which is expected in modulus operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `a` to zero and choose any non-zero integer for `b`.
  Act: Call `mod(a, b)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures the function returns zero when the dividend is zero, which is the correct behavior for modulus operations. This test confirms the function's correctness in handling zero as a dividend.
