### Scenario 1: Test FibonacciRecursive with a small positive integer

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the FibonacciRecursive function correctly calculates the Fibonacci number for a small positive integer input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a small integer, for example, n = 5.
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive with the integer 5.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is 5, which is the fifth Fibonacci number.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the known sequence of Fibonacci numbers where F(5) = 5. This test is important to confirm that the function handles typical small input values correctly and returns the expected Fibonacci sequence value.

### Scenario 2: Test FibonacciRecursive with zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's response when the input is zero, which is the base case for the Fibonacci sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n = 0.
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive with the integer 0.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned value is 0.
Validation:
  According to the Fibonacci sequence definition, F(0) = 0. Validating this ensures that the function correctly handles the lowest edge case, which is critical for accurate sequence generation.

### Scenario 3: Test FibonacciRecursive with one

Details:
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately computes the Fibonacci number for an input of one, another base case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n = 1.
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive with the integer 1.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 1.
Validation:
  As per the Fibonacci sequence, F(1) = 1. This test is essential to verify that the function correctly handles this base case, ensuring reliability in computing the sequence.

### Scenario 4: Test FibonacciRecursive with a negative integer

Details:
  Description: This scenario tests how the function behaves when provided with a negative input, which is not a valid input for calculating Fibonacci numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n = -1.
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive with the integer -1.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully. Depending on implementation details, it might return 0 or -1, or it may not have error handling for this case since the behavior is not defined in the original function.
Validation:
  Fibonacci numbers are not defined for negative integers. Testing this ensures that the function can handle unexpected or out-of-bound inputs gracefully, which is crucial for robustness.

### Scenario 5: Test FibonacciRecursive with a large positive integer

Details:
  Description: Tests the function's performance and correctness when calculating a larger Fibonacci number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n = 20.
  Act: Call FibonacciRecursive with the integer 20.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 6765, which is the 20th Fibonacci number.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure that the function can handle larger inputs without performance degradation or errors, verifying its efficiency and correctness over a broader range of values.
