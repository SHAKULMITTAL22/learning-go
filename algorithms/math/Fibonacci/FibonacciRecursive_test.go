Here are several test scenarios designed for the `FibonacciRecursive` function. These scenarios cover normal operation, edge cases, and potential error handling:

### Scenario 1: Fibonacci of Zero

```
Scenario 1: Fibonacci of Zero

Details:
  Description: This test checks the base case where the input is 0. The function should return 0, as this is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence for n = 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input value n = 0.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with n = 0.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 0.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that F(0) = 0. This test ensures the base case is handled correctly.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Correct handling of base cases is crucial for the correctness of recursive functions.
```

### Scenario 2: Fibonacci of One

```
Scenario 2: Fibonacci of One

Details:
  Description: This test checks the base case where the input is 1. The function should return 1, which is the first Fibonacci number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input value n = 1.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with n = 1.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 1.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that F(1) = 1. This test ensures the function returns the correct value for the first Fibonacci number.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Ensuring base cases return the correct values is essential for recursive functions.
```

### Scenario 3: Fibonacci of a Small Positive Number

```
Scenario 3: Fibonacci of a Small Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function for a small positive integer, such as 5. The function should correctly compute the 5th Fibonacci number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input value n = 5.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with n = 5.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 5.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected Fibonacci number for n = 5 is 5 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5). This test ensures the recursive logic works for small numbers.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: This test validates the correctness of the recursive logic for typical use cases.
```

### Scenario 4: Fibonacci of a Larger Positive Number

```
Scenario 4: Fibonacci of a Larger Positive Number

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function for a larger positive integer, such as 10. The function should compute the 10th Fibonacci number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input value n = 10.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with n = 10.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 55.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected Fibonacci number for n = 10 is 55. This test ensures the recursive function can handle larger inputs correctly.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Testing with larger inputs ensures the function's correctness and efficiency for more complex calculations.
```

### Scenario 5: Negative Input

```
Scenario 5: Negative Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with a negative input. The Fibonacci sequence is not defined for negative numbers, so the function should handle this gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input value n = -1.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with n = -1.
  Assert: Verify that the result is -1, indicating an invalid input.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: Since Fibonacci is undefined for negative numbers, returning the input or an error value like -1 can signify an invalid input.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Handling invalid inputs ensures robustness and prevents unexpected behavior in the application.
```

### Scenario 6: Fibonacci of a Large Number (Performance Test)

```
Scenario 6: Fibonacci of a Large Number (Performance Test)

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's performance and behavior with a large input, such as 30, to see if it handles the recursion depth and time complexity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input value n = 30.
  Act: Call the FibonacciRecursive function with n = 30.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 832040.
Validation:
  Explain the choice of assertion and the logic behind the expected result: The expected Fibonacci number for n = 30 is 832040. This test checks whether the recursive function can handle deeper recursion levels efficiently.
  Discuss the importance of the test in relation to the application's behavior or business requirements: Performance testing ensures the function is practical for large inputs and identifies potential inefficiencies.
```

These scenarios cover a range of inputs and conditions that the `FibonacciRecursive` function should handle, ensuring its correctness and robustness.
